            For mr Foxe reciting some Lawes of <hi rend="italic">Canulus </hi>hathe this, <lb/>
            for one <hi rend="italic">Pecuma Sepultura</hi> etc In English hee saieth itt is <lb/>
            not meete and right <ex>tha</ex>t in Funeralls Monye bee given for <lb/>
            opening the Earthe, if anye Bodie or Course be carryed from <lb/>
            his owne parrish into another, the Monye of the Buriall shall <lb/>

            This lawe cometh home to the Pointe in hand &amp; maketh <lb/>
            it verye Materiall for the Parson, And therefore I blameth <lb/>
            not if they laye good holie on itt as A Warrant of Antiquitie to shew <lb/>
            both their right and their Custome. But you must knowe that this <lb/>
            lawe was not written originallye in Lattine, but in Saxon &amp; <ex>tha</ex>t the <lb/>
            translators haue not delivered it Faithfullye, And it is thus, That <lb/>
            itt must bee that the Soule shott (or money given For the praying for <lb/>
            the Soule) be allwayes payed at the opening of the grave, And <lb/>
            if the Corps be buryed els where then in its owne parrish yett lett <lb/>
            the Soule shott be payed to the Church to w<ex>hi</ex>ch itt belonged

            It is taken Verbatim out of the Synode of Hauham houlde<ex>n</ex> <lb/>
            by Alphage Arch Bishoppe of Canterburye, and Moeston <lb/>
            Arch Bishoppe of Yorke, about Anno 1009: in the tyme of Kinge <lb/>
            Ethelred, And now (A Seculer Parlyament (as I maye call itt <lb/>

            Foxe most vnfaithfullye by Englishing the Lattine, It is meete <lb/>
            and right that in Funerales that monie be given for openinge <lb/>
            the Earthe as the lawe required that monye should bee payed <lb/>
