            First therefore to begynne with <lb/>
            that question, that I suppose will be <lb/>

         <p>
            It is true there is a diversity in these; <lb/>
            For some of these Lawes consider <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi> <lb/>
            as an Enemy Country; Other Lawes <lb/>
            consider it as a forrayne Country only; <lb/>
            As for example, the law of R. 2. An<ex>n</ex>o <lb/>
            7o. w<ex>hi</ex>ch prohibits all Armour or victuall <lb/>
            to be carried to <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>: And the lawe <lb/>
            of 7o. of K. Hen: 7. that enacteth all <lb/>
            the Scottishmen to dep<ex>ar</ex>t the realme <lb/>
            within a tyme prefixed, both these <lb/>
            lawes and some others, respect <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi> <lb/>
            as a Country of Hostility: But the <lb/>
            lawe of 22o. E. 4. that endueth <hi rend="italic">Barwick <lb/>
            </hi>with the libertie of a <hi rend="italic">Staple</hi>, where all <lb/>

                </hi> marchandizes that <lb/>
            should be vttered for <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>, This <lb/>
            Lawe beholdes <hi rend="italic">Scotland </hi>only as a forrayne <lb/>
            <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, and not so much neither, for <lb/>

            For the <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>, make an entire and <lb/>
            p<ex>er</ex>fect <hi rend="italic">vnion</hi>; It is a matter of great <lb/>
            difficulty and length, both in the colle=<lb break="no"/>
            cting of them, and in the passing of them. <lb/>
            There must be made by the <hi rend="italic">Lawyers</hi> <lb/>
            of either nation a <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> vnder titles, <lb/>
            of their seuerall Lawes and Customes, <lb/>
            aswell <hi rend="italic">Com<ex>m</ex>on Lawes</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Statutes</hi>, that <lb/>
            they may be collected and compared, and <lb/>
            that the diversities may appeare and <lb/>
            be discerned of. And for the passing <lb/>
            of them, wee see by experience, that <lb/>
            <hi rend="italic">Patrius Mas</hi> is deare vnto all men, and <lb/>
            that men are bred and nourished vp <lb/>
            in the love of it; and therefore howe <lb/>
            harshe, Changes and Invocations are, <lb/>
            and wee see likewise what disputac<ex>i</ex>on <lb/>
            and argument the alterac<ex>i</ex>on of some <lb/>
            one Lawe doth cause and bring forth: <lb/>
            Howe much more the alterac<ex>i</ex>on of the <lb/>
            whole Corpes of the Lawe. /
         </p>
         <p>
            Therefore the first question will <lb/>
            be, whether it be not good to pro=<lb break="no"/>
            ceed by partes, and to take that is <lb/>
            most necessary, and leaue the rest <lb/>
            to Tyme? The partes therefore <lb/>
            or subiect of the <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>, are for this <lb/>
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">purpose</fw>

            purpose fitliest distributed, accor=<lb break="no"/>
            ding to that ordinary devision of <lb/>
            <hi rend="italic">Criminall and Ciuill</hi>, and those of <hi rend="italic">Cri=<lb break="no"/>
            minall</hi> causes into <hi rend="italic">Capitall &amp; Penall</hi>. /
         </p>
         <p>
            The second question therefore is, <lb/>
            Allowing the generall <hi rend="italic">vnion</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi> <lb/>
            too greate a worke to embrace, whe=<lb break="no"/>
            ther it were not convenient, that <lb/>
            Cases Capitall were the same in both <lb/>
            nations? I saye the Cases, I doe not <lb/>
            speake of the proceeding<ex>es</ex>, or Trialls, <lb/>
            that is to saye, whether the same  <lb/>
            offences were not fitt to be made <lb/>
            Treason or Felony in both places? ./
         </p>
         <p>
            The third question is, whether the <lb/>
            Cases Penall, though not Capitall, <lb/>
            Yet if they concerne the publique<hi rend="italic"> <lb/>
            </hi>state, or otherwise the discipline of <lb/>
            manners, were not fitt likewise to <lb/>
            be brought into one degree; As the <lb/>
            case of misprision of Treason, the <lb/>
            Case of <hi rend="italic">Premunire</hi>, the case of <hi rend="italic">fugi=<lb break="no"/>

         </p>
         <p>
            But the question, that is more vrgent, <lb/>
            then any of these is, whither these <lb/>

            But for <hi rend="italic">Imposts &amp; Customes</hi>, It will <lb/>
            be a great question howe to accomodate <lb/>
            them, and reconcile them. For if they be <lb/>
            much easyer in <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>, then they be here <lb/>
            in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> (w<ex>hi</ex>ch is a thing I know not) then <lb/>
            this Inconvenience will followe, That <lb/>
            the marchant<ex>es</ex> of England, may vnlade in <lb/>
            the portes of <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>, and this kingdome <lb/>
            to be served from thence, and soe yo<ex>u</ex>r ma<ex>jes</ex>t<ex>ies</ex> <lb/>
            customes abated. /
         </p>
         <p>
            And for the question, whether the Scottish <lb/>
            Marchant<ex>es</ex> should paie strangers customes <lb/>
            in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, that rest<ex>es</ex> vpon the point of <lb/>
