            An Army of twenty thousand <lb/>

            five hundred Horse were to bee sent  <lb/>

            Newcastle, because it was doubted <lb/>
            that the Scotts had a designe upon the <lb/>
            Towne. For the defence of it six <lb/>

         <p>
            His lo<ex>rdshi</ex>pp also by his letters to <lb/>
            the lord Generall advised, that Armes <lb/>
            should be gotten, especially Musketts <lb/>
            and sent downe to those of Northum= <lb break="no"/>
            =berland who were willing to pay for <lb/>
            them if they might bee furnisht for <lb/>

            bee sould to them w<ex>i</ex>thout gaines at <lb/>
            easie rates, for that the getting from <lb/>
            the Countrie in that kind will much <lb/>
            discontent them, and discourage them <lb/>
            in his Ma<ex>jes</ex>t<ex>ies</ex> service.
         </p>
         <p>
            Hee also propounded to the  <lb/>
            Towne of Newcastle to furnish men <lb/>
            for their owne defence, and that <lb/>
            the King would arme them, which <lb/>
            they at first denyed to hearken to, <lb/>
            fearing they should bee forced to <lb/>
            Contynue them as trayned Bands, <lb/>
            But upon further Considerac<ex>i</ex>on <lb/>

            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">promised</fw>
            <pb n="226v"/>
            promised to furnish men onely to use <lb/>
            Musketts and Pikes, and the lord <lb/>
            Comoway by sev<ex>er</ex>all letters to the Lord <lb/>
            Generall and other great Ministers, <lb/>
            did rep<ex>re</ex>sent the fittnesse to haue Newcastle <lb/>
            fortified, which w<ex>i</ex>th a moderate Charge  <lb/>
            hee thought might bee made of suffi= <lb break="no"/>
            cient strength, at least to keepe out <lb/>
            an Enemy, untill his Ma<ex>jes</ex>t<ex>ies</ex> Army <lb/>
            might come to releeve it. And there <lb/>
            was one Hill whereon a Fort might <lb/>
            be made aswell to keepe out an <lb/>
            Enemie, as to bridle the Towne if <lb/>
            there should bee cause. And because  <lb/>
            hee found money was wanting, hee  <lb/>
            propounded a way to raise the Charge <lb/>
            of it out of the businesse of the  <lb/>
            Coales, which notw<ex>i</ex>thstanding was <lb/>

            should bee at any Charge for fortifieing the <lb/>
            place in due tyme, the Townesmen being  <lb/>
            unwilling to doe any thing for their owne <lb/>
            safety, that the Towne contynued in that <lb/>
            weake estate wherein the lord Conoway found  <lb/>
            it.

         <p>
            Such Intelligences as could bee gotten <lb/>

            Scotts Army would come into England <lb/>
            w<ex>i</ex>thin three dayes, hee is most Confident <lb/>
            of it, and saith, that there will bee <lb/>

            I have written diu<ex>er</ex>s tymes that it might <lb/>

            bee of noe use, the howses being <lb/>
            all of stone: soe that the walls will <lb/>

            prserved it from surprizall, neither <lb/>
            could the lord Conoway have had <lb/>

            Sir Jacob Ashley had div<ex>er</ex>s tymes <lb/>

            the unrulinesse of the Souldiers, <lb/>
            their want of Armes, and totall <lb/>
            ignorance to use them, which was <lb/>
            such that the Earle of Strafford
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">in the</fw>
            <pb n="235v"/>
            in the great Councell did openly <lb/>
            declare, that hee told his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie that <lb/>
            upon the first sight of the Souldiers <lb/>
            that it was not safe for his Ma<ex>hes</ex>tie to <lb/>

            brought together soe late in July &amp; <lb/>
            August when the service was to bee <lb/>

         <p>
            Yesterday im<ex>m</ex>ediatly after my returne <lb/>

            two of the four were lately discharged <lb/>
            from their Com<ex>m</ex>mands. I doubt extreamly <lb/>
            they are not now in soe suddaine a <lb/>

            A greaat number likewise of exercised <lb/>

            upp new men. And although wee <lb/>
            have from tyme to tyme called upon the <lb/>
            Com<ex>m</ex>anders to exercise often, yet I <lb/>
            fynd, that by reason of the Countries  <lb/>

            =ned by the p<ex>re</ex>sent Army, they have <lb/>
            soe much forborne their dutie, But <lb/>
            which is worst of all, it is much to <lb/>
            bee feared by those murmurs and <lb/>
            repynings that fall from all our <lb/>
            Gentries mouthes in eu<ex>er</ex>y place &amp; <lb/>
            upon all occasions, that they will <lb/>
            not stirr w<ex>i</ex>th their men farther <lb/>
            then the necessitie of their owne <lb/>
            safety will enforce them, which they <lb/>
            thinke will sufficiently bee prserved <lb/>
            if they march into the Confynes of <lb/>
            their Countrie.

         <p>
            I p<ex>er</ex>ceive likewise by some of them <lb/>

            six of our Regiment<ex>es</ex> should have <lb/>
            marched to Newcastle. I beseech <lb/>
            God worke better affecc<ex>i</ex>ons in us then <lb/>
            that I fynd, for I am p<ex>er</ex>swaded that <lb/>

            to trust the Souldiers for 14. dayes, <lb/>

            men appointed for the Borders, <lb/>
            there should bee onely fourteene <lb/>
            or fifteene thousand, for the paying <lb/>

            first Councell which designed soe <lb/>
            powerfull an Invasion, and was <lb/>
            then forced a defensive warr, and <lb/>
            upon all possible disadvantage, that <lb/>
            the lord Conoway had iust reason to <lb/>
            beleeve, that not onely Newcastle <lb/>
            would bee lost, but God knowes <lb/>
            how much of England more, if <lb/>
            that an Invader would attempt <lb/>
            and those of the Countrie would <lb/>
            not defend, And therefore did <lb/>

            it would have fallen out soe, for <lb/>

            the Scotts might bee stayed at <lb/>

            did murmur that Northumb<ex>er</ex>land  <lb/>

            armed, leaving 4000. behind him <lb/>

         <p>
            Sir Jacob Ashley had used all <lb/>
            diligence to make Quarters for the <lb/>
            Souldiers w<ex>i</ex>thout the Towne for security <lb/>

            River of Tyne, which was found <lb/>
            to have many Foards, and the higher <lb/>
            upp the River were the Foards the <lb/>
            larger and the shallower.
         </p>
         <p>
            And because it was beleeved <lb/>
            that the Enemy would passe at <lb/>
            Newburne, hee had caused the <lb/>

            there, and in obedience from the <lb/>
            Court to use all meanes possible <lb/>

            had resolued to make retreat to <lb/>

            to stay there would but increase the  <lb/>
            losse, it would not save any thing. <lb/>
            The gaineing of two or three dayes <lb/>
            could not much strengthen the Towne <lb/>
            there being not any place which could <lb/>
            bee made defencible in that tyme, and <lb/>
            the losse of our men would greatly <lb/>
            lessen the Kings Army, and this was <lb/>
            agreeable to that which was thought <lb/>
            fitt at the Court, For w<ex>i</ex>th all speed <lb/>
            Orders were dispatched by seu<ex>er</ex>all <lb/>
            wayes to Com<ex>m</ex>and the bringing of the <lb/>
            Army, from Newcastle, as it appeares <lb/>
            by the ensueing letters from the <lb/>
            Earle of Strafford both dated the <lb/>
            29th: of August in these words  <lb/>
            following.

         <p>
            After my heartie Com<ex>m</ex>endac<ex>i</ex>ons <lb/>
            to your lo<ex>rdshi</ex>pp and the rest. This <lb/>
            sadd accident which hath befallen  <lb/>
            us upon the passing of the Scotts
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">ou<ex>er</ex> Tyne</fw>
            <pb n="246r"/>
            ou<ex>er</ex> Tyne, will fetch all our Councells <lb/>
            round; There is noe remedie wee <lb/>
            must retyre, and (as I thinke) to <lb/>
            Hull, the Horse to Durham. I  <lb/>
            shall gather and settle the best I <lb/>
            can, and soe march upp to ioyne <lb/>
            w<ex>i</ex>th the rest of such Horse and Foote <lb/>
            as are left us, And how to fetch yt. <lb/>
            part of our Foote that are at  <lb/>
            Newcastle is (God knowes) our greatest <lb/>
            Care and difficultie. I send you this <lb/>
            by the way of Sunderland, I will <lb/>
            before I sleepe send another to <lb/>
            Hexcombe. In my opinion your best <lb/>
            will bee to shipp your selues if <lb/>
            possible you can and amount for  <lb/>
            Hull, that were best, But if that <lb/>
            cannot bee, then  if the Towne bee <lb/>
            not to bee held any longer, to make <lb/>
            the best Composic<ex>i</ex>on for your selues <lb/>
            w<ex>i</ex>th Honor. But therein I must wholy <lb/>
            submitt it to your Judgment <lb/>
            upon the place. And soe in hast I
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">Com<ex>m</ex>itt </fw>

         <p>
            Before I had closed this letter, his  <lb/>
            Matie: came to this Towne, who approves <lb/>
            of all before written, onely adviseth <lb/>
            that if there bee any possibilitie of <lb/>
            keeping the Towne, then (that shipping <lb/>
            the rest) you leave 2000. men in the <lb/>
            Towne to defend it.
         </p>
         <p>
            It was very good newes here to  <lb/>
            mee, to understand that the Foote are <lb/>
            all advanced on this side of Durham, <lb/>
            nor is there any thing to bee done <lb/>
            more then to loose noe more tyme in <lb/>
            your retreat, for there is noe <lb/>
            thought of fighting w<ex>i</ex>th an affrighted <lb/>
            Army till they ioyne w<ex>i</ex>th the Kings <lb/>
            Forces, which I trust will bee <lb/>
            neere 20000. I will use all possible <lb/>
            diligence to provide asmuch bread <lb/>
            as possible I can in this Towne, <lb/>
            and have giue<ex>n</ex> Order that 8000li. <lb/>

            putt asmuch life in yor: men as you <lb/>
            can, and assure them w<ex>i</ex>thin a few dayes <lb/>
            there will bee 80000li: on the way <lb/>
            from London, which will give eu<ex>er</ex>y <lb/>
            man his owne really, wee shall <lb/>

            buyeing (here and at Northallerton <lb/>
            as also about the Countrie) And I <lb/>
            trust from Yorke wee shall have <lb/>
            good quantities meet us in the way. <lb/>
            I shall thinke the tyme long till I see <lb/>
            you and Sir Jacob Ashley, to whom I <lb/>
            pray you shew this letter, and I pray <lb/>
            you have some Horsmen behind you, <lb/>

         <p>
            And although the Towne of <lb/>
            Newcastle had beene kept some <lb/>
            dayes yet would it not have <lb/>
            beene w<ex>i</ex>th any advantage to the
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">Kings</fw>
            <pb n="247v"/>
            Kings service seeing hee had noe <lb/>
            monies. And by all guesses his Cheifest <lb/>
            strength being in Choyce men that <lb/>
            were at Newcastle, and it would <lb/>
            have beene much to the Kings disser= <lb break="no"/>
            =vice to have putt those men inevi= <lb break="no"/>
            =tably to have undergone base Condi= <lb break="no"/>
            -c<ex>i</ex>ons when they must compound w<ex>i</ex>th <lb/>
            the Towne if it had pleased the <lb/>
            Invader.
         </p>
         <p>
            Besides these reasons, though there  <lb/>
            was a good quantitie of powder &amp; <lb/>
            lead in the Towne, yet there <lb/>
            wanted Musketts &amp; Bulletts, there <lb/>
            being noe Moulds to make them, w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>
            want cannot bee imputed to a <lb/>
            Com<ex>m</ex>ander any more, then if hee <lb/>
            com<ex>m</ex>anded a certaine number of <lb/>
            Musketiers, And that when they came <lb/>
            to use their Musketts they could not <lb/>
            doe service for want of scowring <lb/>
            sticks; If there had beene Moulds <lb/>
            Bulletts would not have beene

            wanting, but Bulletts would not <lb/>
            have served to keepe a Towne that <lb/>
            wanted fortificac<ex>i</ex>on.

         <p>
            Now upon the whole matter it <lb/>
            may easily bee iudged, whether those <lb/>
            two single Actions of the Retreat of <lb/>
            Newcastle, and quitting of Newcastle, <lb/>
            were the Causes of o<ex>u</ex>r losses, or the <lb/>
            defect of ill grounded designes, to <lb/>
            make a warr w<ex>i</ex>thout monies, to goe <lb/>
            on w<ex>i</ex>th it, and to beginne it at Sea, <lb/>
            thereby giving the Scott<ex>es</ex> a p<ex>re</ex>tence to <lb/>
