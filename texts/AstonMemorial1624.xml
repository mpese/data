            either by Padre Maestro or your Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties Ambassadors <lb/> 
            wh<ex>i</ex>ch haue resided these daies past in his Court, there was <lb/> 
            somethinge to be propounded and declared touching the <lb/> 
            busines of the Pallatynate whereby he might receiue <lb/> 
            satisfaction: The said Ambassadors till  nowe haue not <lb/> 
            said anythinge at all to purpose, which compareing <lb/> 
            with other Circumstances of their ill Carriage <lb/>

            Furthermore he saith That the Kinge his maister hath <lb/> 
            Comaunded him to giue Accompt to your Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie that in an <lb/> 
            audience wh<ex>i</ex>ch he gaue to the Marquesse of Inijosa, and Don <lb/> 
            Carlos Colonna they vnder cloake and p<ex>re</ex>text of zeale and <lb/> 
            p<ex>ar</ex>ticuler Care of his p<ex>er</ex>son, pretended to discouer vnto him <lb/> 
            a very great coniuration against his p<ex>er</ex>son and Royall <lb/> 
            dignitie. And it was, 
         </p>
         <p>
            That at the begining of the p<ex>ar</ex>liament the Duke <lb/> 
            of Buckingham had consulted with certaine Lordes, of <lb/> 
            the argumentes and meanes wh<ex>i</ex>ch were to be taken touching <lb/> 
            the breaking and dissoluing of the treaties of the Pallati=<lb break="no"/>
            nate and Match; And their Consultations passed soe <lb/> 
            farr, That if his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie would not accomodate himselfe <lb/> 
            to their Counsells, they would giue him a house of pleasure, <lb/> 
            whether he might retire himselfe to his sportes, in regard <lb/> 
            that the Prince had nowe yeares sufficient and parts <lb/> 
            answerable for the good gou<ex>er</ex>ment of the Kingdome./
         </p>
         <p>
            The information was of that quallitie, that it was <lb/> 
            sufficient to putt impression in him of perpetuall <lb/> 
            iealousies; in regard that throughe the Ribbs of the <lb/> 
            Duke he gaue woundes to the Prince his sonne and no=<lb break="no"/>
            billitie And it is not probable that they could bringe <lb/> 
            to effect such designes without departing totally from <lb/> 
            the obligation, faith, and Loyaltie wh<ex>i</ex>ch they owed to his <lb/> 
            p<ex>er</ex>son and Crowne, because the Lordes made themselues <lb/> 
            Culpable, as concealers: And it is not like that the <lb/> 
            Duke would hurle himselfe into such an enterprise <lb/> 
            without Comunicating first with the Prince and <lb/> 
            knoweing his pleasure./
         </p>
         <p>
            And because this Information might be made <lb/> 
            more cleare, he did make many instances to the <lb/> 
            said Ambassadors, that they would giue him the <lb/> 
            Authors of the said Coniuration; This beinge the <lb/> 
            sole meanes whereby their owne honor might be <lb/> 
            preserued, and wherebye the great zeale and care they <lb/> 
            p<ex>re</ex>tended to haue of his p<ex>er</ex>son might appeare. But <lb/> 
            instead of confirminge the great zeale they had <lb/> 
            p<ex>re</ex>tended to beare him, All the answere they made <lb/> 
            him consisted of Argumentes against the discouerie <lb/> 
            of the Conspirators. So that for confirmation of the <lb/> 
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">said</fw>
            <pb n="12r"/>
            said Report there remained no other meanes then the <lb/> 
            examination of some of his Counsell of State and prin=<lb break="no"/>
            cipall subiectes, wh<ex>i</ex>ch he putt in execution; and made them <lb/> 
            take oath euery one p<ex>ar</ex>ticulerly in his owne p<ex>re</ex>sence; and <lb/> 
            comaunded that such interrogateries and questions <lb/> 
            should be propounded vnto them, that were most p<ex>er</ex>tinent <lb/> 
            to the accusation; so that neither partes, p<ex>ar</ex>ticle, or Circum=<lb break="no"/>
            stance remained, wh<ex>i</ex>ch was not exactly examined and winnowed; <lb/> 
            And he found in the Duke and the rest that were accused, <lb/> 
            a cleere and sinceere innocency touching the Accusations <lb/> 
            and Imputations wherewith they were charged./
         </p>
         <p>
            This being soe he turned to make new instances <lb/> 
            vnto the said Ambassadors, that they should not preferr <lb/> 
            the discouerie of the names of the conspirators to the <lb/> 
            securitie of his royall p<ex>er</ex>son, and truth and honor of them=<lb break="no"/>
            selues, and the hazard of an opinion to be held and iudged <lb/> 
            the raisers of a plott of such mallice, sedition and dainger <lb/> 
            But the Ambassadors remained in a knotty kinde <lb/> 
            of obstinancie, resoluing to conceale the Authors./
         </p>
         <p>
            Neuerthelesse afterwardes he gaue them Audience <lb/> 
            Wherein the Marquesse of Iniosa tooke his Leave./
         </p>
         <p>
            Few daies after they demaunded newe Audience pre=<lb break="no"/>
            tending that they had something to say that concerned the <lb/> 
            publique good, and conduced to the intire restitution <lb/> 
            of the Pallatinate. And the Kinge his maister, with <lb/> 
            desire to loose noe oportunitie that might lead there=<lb break="no"/>
            vnto, and therewith the conseruation and confirmation of <lb/> 
            the Frendship with your Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie haueing suspended some <lb/> 
            fewe daies to giue them Audience, thinkeing, that being <lb/> 
            thereby better aduised, they would resolue upon a wiser <lb/> 
            course, and declare the Authors of soe <expan>p<ex>er</ex>nitious</expan> an <lb/> 
            Action: And haueing since made many instances, <lb/> 
            and attended the successe of so longe Patience, He sent <lb/> 
            Secretarie Conwaye and S<ex>i</ex>r Francis Cottington <lb/> 
            secretarie to the Prince, comaunding them, that they <lb/> 
            should signifie vnto the Ambassadors, that he desired <lb/> 
            nothinge more then the Continuance of the frendship <lb/> 
            twixt both Crownes; And that if so be that they had <lb/> 
            anything to say, that they would comunicate it to the <lb/>
