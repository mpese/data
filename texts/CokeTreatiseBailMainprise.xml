            (:2: Secondlye the Pleadges / and Suerties of him that is delivered / <lb/>
            to Bayle / maye impryson him whose Suerties they are / For Cheife <lb/>
            Iustice / Shard / in the xxxiii Ed: 3: said that they were <ex>th</ex>e Gaolers <lb/>

            for the same Escape /

         <p>
            3: Thirdlye the verye Etimologie of either of them / doth shewe / <lb/>
            and manifest the difference betwixt them; For in the One <ex>th</ex>e p<ex>ri</ex>son<ex>er</ex> <lb/>
            is delivered by the Iudge /Iudge / Iudges / or Cou<ex>r</ex>te into <ex>th</ex>e handes / <lb/>

            herevnto might be Answered / that Iustices of the Peace could <lb/>
            not Bayle A Suspected person for Fellonye before Iudgem<ex>en</ex>t <lb/>
            or Appeale / For two Causes
         </p>
         <p>
            <add place="LM">(1)</add>
            First that noe Iustice of the Peace (For w<ex>i</ex>th Him I will medle <lb/>
            in this Treatie / is A Iudge or any such person before Indictm<ex>en</ex>t or <lb/>
            Appeale brought / And therefore could not lett him to Bayle or <lb/>
            Mainprise; For it were Absurd to saye / And directlye contrary to <lb/>
            the Etimologie of the worde / that he should deliver anye Person to Bayle/ <lb/>
            that were not Iudge of <ex>th</ex>e person of him / <ex>tha</ex>t were to be Bayled
         </p>
         <p>
            <add place="LM">(2:)</add>
            The Second Reason is / for that Iustices of the Peace are before <lb/>
            Appeale brought / or Indictm<ex>en</ex>t noe Iustices of the Cause wherefore <lb/>
            he is ymprisoned / And therefore doth it followe <ex>tha</ex>t by the Como<ex>n</ex> Laws <lb/>
            they could nott lett such persons to Bayle
         </p>
         <p>
            But heere rises A Second Question / as doubtfull / as the First <lb/>
            whie Iustices of the Peace / are neith<ex>e</ex>r Iudges of the Person / nor the <lb/>
            Cause / in <ex>th</ex>e Case aforesaid / before Indictment / or Appeale brought
         </p>
         <p>
            This doubte is fullye resolved by the opynion of the whole Court <lb/>
            in the xiiij H: 4: 16: where it is said / that A Iustice of <ex>th</ex>e Peace / is A <lb/>
            Iudge of Recorde / and therefore ought to p<ex>ro</ex>ceed vpon that thing w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>

            First it is to be agreed /that both the Statute of 28: Hen: 8: Cap: 13: <lb/>
            All Murtherers / Pyracies / Robberyes / and all other offences done vpo<ex>n</ex> <lb/>

            want of sufficient Testimonie (Murther being of the shadow of pyracye) <lb/>
            As allsoe by Reason of the Perverse and obstinate obstina<ex>n</ex>cye of the <lb/>
            offendors (An Indictm<ex>en</ex>t seperable to the Pyratt / in not confessing <lb/>

         </p>
         <p>
            This Mischeiffe was Remedied by the Stat<ex>ute</ex> of 28 Henry 8: Ca: 13 <lb/>
            whereby it is p<ex>ro</ex>vided / that all Treasons/ Robberyes / Fellonyes / <lb/>

         </p>
         <p>
            Of this much I gather / that heerevnto the said offendors word not <lb/>
            Bayleable / neither by the Como<ex>n</ex> Lawe / nor by anye statute / For how <lb/>
            Could they be Bayleable by the Como<ex>n</ex> Lawe / where the offence was <lb/>
            not determinable / by the Como<ex>n</ex> Lawe / And I finde noe statute / that <lb/>
            taketh awaye the Tryall of those offences From the Civill Law vnto <lb/>
            the statut<ex>e</ex> of 28: H: 8: w<ex>hi</ex>ch statute doth not make anye Provision at <lb/>
            all/ For letting the said offendors to Bayle / Therefore I doe conclude <lb/>
            that w<ex>i</ex>thout anye greate doubt (as mee seemeth / such offenders before <lb/>
            Indictm<ex>en</ex>t were not Bayleable before the Comissioners / neither by the <lb/>
