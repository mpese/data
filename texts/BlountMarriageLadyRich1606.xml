            or lawe of nature are bounde w<ex>i</ex>th patience to suffer the penaltye, but <lb/>
            not in conscience to obey the lawe, But in case of marriage att the <lb/>
            least concerninge the lawfullnes thereof it seemeth heere in England <lb/>
            that <hi rend="italic">Ius Poli</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ius fori</hi> are allone. For the by the statute in the  <lb/>

            by the word of God to marry notw<ex>i</ex>thstandinge any Statute or Acte <lb/>
            to the contrary. In the question therefore whether it be lawfull  <lb/>
            for two betweene whome a marriage was lawfully contracted and <lb/>
            consum<ex>m</ex>ated after a sentence of divorce to marry w<ex>i</ex>th another bothe <lb/>

            is onely necessarie to see whether by the word of God it bee prohibited  <lb/>
            to marry as this case standeth, for otherwaies the marriage is <lb/>
            lawfull. In w<ex>hi</ex>ch considerac<ex>i</ex>on there is nothinge to bee alledged but the <lb/>
            word of God, although the lawes of nature Nations and the iudgement  <lb/>

            of soe much of the word of God as shalbe produced to the purpose; To <lb/>
            determine this matter itt is first fitt to bee handled whether a marriage <lb/>
            lawfully contracted &amp; consumated may be by any meanes vtterly <lb/>
            dissolued and the bond vntied duringe the lyves of boeth the p<ex>ar</ex>ties w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>
            were first married, Nowe since heerein wee are to be resolued by the word  <lb/>
            of God. <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> whoe is the lyvinge word and the word of lyfe doethe  <lb/>
            direct vs where wee must begin and that is at the begining And first <lb/>
            instituc<ex>i</ex>on of marriage for in question of this matter hee doth call <lb/>
            the <hi rend="italic">Pharises</hi> from the present practice and opinion to the considerac<ex>i</ex>on  <lb/>
            of the first instituc<ex>i</ex>on of marriage where hee saith But from the  <lb/>
            begininge itt was <add place="above" hand="#h2">not</add> soe. / . The first instituc<ex>i</ex>on was by God in parradize <lb/>
            and betweene the first man and the first woman in the state of p<ex>er</ex>fecc<ex>i</ex>on <lb/>
            The finall end was because it was not good for man to bee alone that <lb/>
            hee might haue a helpe fitt for him, The efficient cause was the <lb/>
            consent of bothe p<ex>ar</ex>ties wherein it is sayd when God had made <lb/>
            the woman and brought her to the man, hee sayd this now is bone of my <lb/>
            bones and <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> of my <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi>. The matter and essence of marriage <lb/>
            is the fast adheringe w<ex>hi</ex>ch is expressed in theise words, Therefore shall <lb/>
            man leaue his father and his mother and shall cleaue vnto his wife <lb/>
            and they shalbe one flesh / The rule of marriage out of this instituc<ex>i</ex>on <lb/>
            is concluded by the wordes and wisdome of God to be this <hi rend="italic">let</hi> <lb/>
            noe man therefore put asunder whome God that <hi rend="italic">coupled</hi> together / .

            allowe some exceptions agreable to the weakenes of o<ex>u</ex>r nature <lb/>
