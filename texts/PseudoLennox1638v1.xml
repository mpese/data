            Most gratious Soveraigne,

         <p>
            I am not alltogether unsensible of <ex>th</ex>e businesse, wherin I am now called to <lb/>
            giue my advise, I know <ex>tha</ex>t I shall suffer some disadvantage because I am a <lb/>
            Scott by nation, &amp; education, &amp; <ex>th</ex>e best blood <ex>tha</ex>t runns in my veines I haue extraited <lb/>
            from thence. What I shall now speake examine.
         </p>
         <p>
            Some p<ex>er</ex>happs may impute as p<ex>ro</ex>ceeding from <ex>th</ex>e streame of affection to <ex>th</ex>e <lb/>
            place, &amp; people from whence I come, but I p<ex>ro</ex>test my zeale to yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie shall <lb/>
            at this time suspend <ex>th</ex>e agitation of such principles, &amp; I will sett aside all p<ex>ar</ex>ticular <lb/>

            it forth.
         </p>
         <p>
            The question is concerning Warre, an unknowne subj<ex>ec</ex>t, sweete to yo<ex>u</ex>s <ex>tha</ex>t haue <lb/>

            the conqueror hath had little wherof to glory. 
         </p>
         <p>
            But this is not a warre betweene a king, &amp; a stranger, but betweene a Sove<lb break="no"/>

         </p>
         <p>
            But these are not such subj<ex>ec</ex>ts, as <ex>th</ex>e kingly p<ex>ro</ex>phett speakes of, A people w<ex>ho</ex>m <lb/>
            I know not, shalbe subi<ex>ec</ex>t to me, but yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ty may say of <ex>the</ex>m as Adam s<ex>ai</ex>d <lb/>

            rex factus, but Rex natus; &amp; <ex>the</ex>rfore <ex>th</ex>e union being so streight, <ex>th</ex>e motives had need <lb/>
            be weighty to dissolue <ex>th</ex>e same, <ex>th</ex>e reasons had need be very solid. <ex>tha</ex>t should cause <lb/>
            a wise, &amp; sober man to sett his owne house on fire, or destroy <ex>th</ex>e worke of <lb/>
            his owne hands.
         </p>
         <p>
            Let us now consider of 2 things .1. The Necessity of <ex>th</ex>e Warre .2ly <ex>th</ex>e Motiues <lb/>
            to it; whether any of <ex>the</ex>m be of such moment, <ex>tha</ex>t a king shold hazard <ex>th</ex>e uncertaine <lb/>
            chance of warre, &amp; <ex>th</ex>e miseries <ex>tha</ex>t do accompany <ex>th</ex>e same, rather <ex>the</ex>n to refuse it. For <lb/>
            First it is a good observac<ex>i</ex>on of Tacitus <ex>tha</ex>t <foreign xml:lang="la">Bellu<ex>m</ex>

            haue worne, or carried scepters w<ex>i</ex>thin latter times, we shall find how willing they <lb/>
            haue beene to decline <ex>th</ex>e stroake of Warre allmost upon any termes. If yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ty <lb/>
            considers <ex>th</ex>e practice of Lewis <ex>th</ex>e 11th of France, &amp; of Henry <ex>th</ex>e 7th of England, <lb/>

            yet w<ex>ha</ex>t meanes they used, or rather left not <del rend="strikethrough">unf</del> <unclear>unusued</unclear> to decline, &amp; divert <lb/>
            the course of warre, if at any times it came w<ex>i</ex>thin <ex>thei</ex>r channells, appeares by <ex>thei</ex>r <lb/>
            courses, in <ex>tha</ex>t they esteemed it noe dishonour to yield unto <ex>thei</ex>r subj<ex>ec</ex>ts demands,
            though somtimes uniust, &amp; unreasonable; Nay they are to be the first seekers, &amp; <lb/>
            propounders of peace, &amp; so by those meanes when the storme hath beene over, <lb/>
            &amp; things came to be debated upon the greene carpett, they became M<ex>aste</ex>rs of <lb/>

         </p>
         <p>
            There are 3 meanes to be used, <ex>tha</ex>t haue not yett beene tried, any of w<ex>hi</ex>ch is better <lb/>

            First, remoue <ex>th</ex>e occasion. this can be no impeachm<ex>en</ex>t to <ex>th</ex>e sceptre, <ex>th</ex>e wisest <lb/>

            no man was more zealous of kingly governm<ex>en</ex>t <ex>tha</ex>n he. It is an act of <ex>th</ex>e extreamest <lb/>

            <add place="LM">2.</add>
            If this like not, <ex>the</ex>n let time worke it out, &amp; by this meanes they will either swallow <lb/>
            the hooke, or endure <ex>th</ex>e proposall w<ex>i</ex>th lesse regreet. Distastfull things make most <lb/>
            at first, lesse afterwards, by degrees yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ty may worke <ex>the</ex>m to <ex>tha</ex>t, w<ex>hi</ex>ch for <ex>th</ex>e pr<ex>e</ex>sent <lb/>

            termes, had hardly beene accomplished, if ever. So Norman William by degrees <lb/>
            brought <ex>th</ex>e English to weare <ex>th</ex>e yoake, w<ex>hi</ex>ch if it had at first beene tendered, he <lb/>

            impatient then w<ex>e</ex>r<ex>e</ex> <ex>th</ex>e English to heare of a conquerour, or to be branded w<ex>i</ex>th the <lb/>

         <p>
            Wee see the way to conquerre is somtimes to fly; what if yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ty <lb/>
            shold seeme to yeild in this matter to <ex>th</ex>e Scotts demands; &amp; give <ex>the</ex>m <ex>th</ex>e ad-<lb break="no"/>
            vantage of a faire game, cannott yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ty remoue <ex>th</ex>e obstacle by degrees, <lb/>
            turning <ex>th</ex>e humour some other wayes; waite <ex>the</ex>n a more seasonable opportunity <lb/>
            to serue in these things w<ex>i</ex>th instrum<ex>en</ex>ts more fitt, &amp; lesse subi<ex>ec</ex>t to exception. <lb/>
            the proposall of this course I shold hold more safe, &amp; more secure <ex>the</ex>n <ex>th</ex>e cru-<lb break="no"/>
            ell one of <ex>th</ex>e sword, w<ex>hi</ex>ch knoweth no law but this, The Sword devoureth one <lb/>
            as well as another; and I shold hold <ex>th</ex>e kingdome most miserable, <ex>tha</ex>t w<ex>a</ex>s forced <lb/>
            to make use of a remedy worse <ex>the</ex>n <ex>th</ex>e desease.
         </p>
         <p>
            Thus much for <ex>th</ex>e First thing, <ex>tha</ex>t <ex>the</ex>r<ex>e</ex> is no necessity of warre <foreign xml:lang="la">Rebus <lb/>
            sic stantibus</foreign>.
         </p>
         <p>
            For these things in agitation are not tanti, of such alley as shold require <lb/>
            such a desperate adventure, as to hazard a kingdome at a cast for <ex>th</ex>e gaining of it. <lb/>
            Plutarch wisely compares those who know not how to proportion the meanes <lb/>
            to the end to such as fish w<ex>i</ex>th a golden hooke, <ex>th</ex>e losse of <ex>th</ex>e hooke is of more <lb/>
            consequence <ex>the</ex>n <ex>th</ex>e fish <ex>tha</ex>t is taken. Indeed to speake plainly what I thinke, they <ex>tha</ex>t <lb/>
            advise warre in this kingdomes case, know not what it is to gett, nor greatly <lb/>
            care for <ex>th</ex>e losse of a kingdome, so <ex>tha</ex>t they may play <ex>thei</ex>r owne game, &amp; fish <lb/>
            in troubled waters.
         </p>
         <p>
            Such counsellors as these w<ex>e</ex>r<ex>e</ex> <ex>th</ex>e B<ex>isho</ex>p of Rosse to <ex>th</ex>e Queene of Scotts, &amp; <ex>th</ex>e <lb/>

            guests <ex>tha</ex>t both <ex>th</ex>e nations may wish they never know <ex>th</ex>e way thither againe. <lb/>
            Three reasons haue beene given to perswade to warre, w<ex>hi</ex>ch I will not <lb/>
