            The Kinges Ma<ex>ies</ex>tie calling to mynde yo<ex>ur</ex> many services to <lb/>

            learning accompanied with much dexteritie in accomplishing <lb/>
            of busines of weight, hath appointed yow to succeed the
            place vacant in this Court, and here to sitt as cheife <lb/>
            Iustice; In this you see manifest argument of the
            singuler goodnes of the King and Queene so myndefull <lb/>
            of their servantes imitating God above, that rewardes <lb/>

            acknowledge with David, that yo<ex>u</ex>r cupp doeth <lb/>

                </foreign>, yet <lb/>
            they are not to be received so by them that have <lb/>
            them, but as fruites sowne in fruitfull ground to
            them that receive them: And of this nature is yo<ex>u</ex>r <lb/>

            fruitfull to his people: I remember in <foreign xml:lang="la">Rotulo <lb/>

                </foreign> in a great cause <lb/>
            betwixt Humfry de Bohun and Gilbert de Clare <lb/>
            it was said of that King, who was as great a <lb/>
            lawgiver, as a victorious Prince, and therefore <lb/>
            stiled the Iustinian of England <foreign xml:lang="la">

               Iustitiae debitor</hi>
                </foreign>, The King our Master, as much <lb/>
            as any, makes the same acknowledgement in <lb/>
            practise, (never any king, I may say never any <lb/>
            man of a Iuster or more vpright hart) that <lb/>
            equall Iustice should be minstred to his subiectes: <lb/>
            For hee knowes well, that <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">Rex et subditus</hi>
                </foreign> are
            correlatives even as man and wife, and the <lb/>
            Emblemme of the king not wanting betwixt them, <lb/>
            As the subiect owes obedience, so the king protection <lb/>
            and Iustice. This debt is <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">debitum Iustitiae</hi>
                </foreign>, too <lb/>
            great and heavy a burden to be borne by a king <lb/>
            compounded onely of mortall flesh, were it not <lb/>
            that his Counsell were as religious and Iust, as <lb/>
            hee wise and politique, and thereby the load of <lb/>
            kinges busines is lighted by laying a part <add place="above">of</add> that <lb/>
            great and insupportable burden <del rend="strikethrough">of</del> <add place="above">on</add> Iudges: for <lb/>
            this <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">debitum Iustitiae</hi>
                </foreign>, which is the debt of a <lb/>
            King primarily by secondary meanes becomes the <lb/>
            debt of Iudges, and under as great bondes as may <lb/>
            be, greater there cannot be to bynde the <lb/>
            consciences of men, The first Bond is <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">debitum <lb/>
               Patriae</hi>
                </foreign> due to all the Kinges people, whose causes <lb/>
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">and pleas</fw>
            <pb ed="Item 4" n="12r" facs="/nro/rye_20/rye_20-017/rye_20-017.jpg"/>
            and pleas are the proper subiectes of this <lb/>
            Tribunall, and whose flourishing estate dependes <lb/>
            much vpon the iust proceedinges of this Court, were <lb/>
            there no other motive, yet this that prevailes <lb/>
            among the heathen <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">amor Patriae</hi>
                </foreign> were strong enough <lb/>
            to make Iudges desirous of this duty. The second is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">debitum Regi</hi>
                </foreign>, For hee trustes them with his richest <lb/>
            treasure, that which is dearer then the apple of his <lb/>
            eye. This Iustice is one prime and principall part <lb/>
            of his oath at his Coronation <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">facies eis in omnibus <lb/>
               Iustitiam aequam et rectam</hi>
                </foreign>, And what you are to give <lb/>
            the king for this you shall need to goe no further <lb/>
            then yo<ex>u</ex>r oath, the neglect of which puttes you in the <lb/>
            will of the king for body, landes and goodes. The third <lb/>
            the greatest of all is <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">debitum Deo</hi>
                </foreign>, as hee is the <lb/>
            Fountayne of all Iustice, and a fearefull revenger <lb/>
            of all them, that doe the contrary. And three <lb/>
            wayes shall mynde yow how this is a debt to God. <lb/>
            First <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">Ratione iuramenti</hi>
                </foreign>, by reason of yo<ex>u</ex>r oath, for <lb/>
            the imediate relation it hath to God. That it is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">Religio Iuris iurandi</hi>
                </foreign> and therfore vnder this oath <lb/>
            you are bound to God in a full discharge, Secondly <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">Ratione loci</hi>
                </foreign>, for the seate of Iudges, God sittes <lb/>
            whereon you sitt, And you assure yo<ex>u</ex>r selfe, that hee <lb/>
            that settes you there, will take a strict accompt of <lb/>
            yow. Thirdly <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">Ratione Iudicij</hi>
                </foreign> the Iudgement it <lb/>
            selfe is Godes, if you be vpright as yow ought: It is <lb/>
            said in the 82 psalme, God standes in the <lb/>
            congregation of Princes, hee is the Iudge among Godes. <lb/>
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">And so</fw>
            <pb ed="Item 4" n="12v" facs="/nro/rye_20/rye_20-018/rye_20-018.jpg"/>
            And so when you sitt here, yow must thinck that <lb/>
            God is in yo<ex>u</ex>r face to give Iudgement, as it is <lb/>
            right, or otherwise to punish, And therefore, <lb/>
            whensoever you shall sett yo<ex>u</ex>r selfe on yo<ex>u</ex>r cushion either <lb/>
            here or in any other place, yow have cause to say, <lb/>
            as Iacob did when hee slept in Bethell, how <lb/>
            wonderfull is this place? this is the house of God. <lb/>
            Thus vpon the generall I feare I have spent too=<lb break="no"/>
            much tyme, I will make amendes in the p<ex>ar</ex>ticuler, <lb/>
            somewhat for order, <foreign xml:lang="la">Co<ex>mmun</ex>ia Pl<ex>ac</ex>ita</foreign> is the pleas of <lb/>
            the people, and as they are numberles, so necessarily <lb/>
            must their pleas and causes; therefore they are <lb/>
            all civill, whether for landes, goodes, reall, p<ex>er</ex>sonall <lb/>
            or mixt: they are the proper obiect of this Court. <lb/>
            First therefore you must vse diligence in attending <lb/>
            and dispatching the multitude of businesses in this Court: <lb/>
            Com<ex>m</ex>on Industry may discharge com<ex>m</ex>on imploymentes; <lb/>
            but this is a sup<ex>er</ex>lative and transcendent, And therefore <lb/>
            yo<ex>u</ex>r diligence must be extraordinary: Secondly yow must <lb/>
            vse great patience in matters brought before yow: <lb/>
            I must confesse, that a multitude of busines and a <lb/>
            good will to dispatch will as soone trye ones patience <lb/>
            as any thing yet whatsoever tryall yow are putt <lb/>
            to, be not from yo<ex>u</ex>r tryall: nothing better becomes <lb/>
            a Iudge then patience. Thirdly yow must vse <lb/>
            great caution in discerning those thinges brought <lb/>
            before yow: For those, that have ill causes, will <lb/>
            omitt no indeavour to beguile yow: Therefore yow <lb/>
            must keepe watch and ward and try every thing, <lb/>
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">that no</fw>
            <pb ed="Item 4" n="13r" facs="/nro/rye_20/rye_20-018/rye_20-018.jpg"/>
            That no counterfett coyne be putt vpon you. <lb/>
            Then in the fowerth place it is necessary to vse <lb/>
            all expedic<ex>i</ex>on: <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">nulli differrimus</hi>
                </foreign> is coupled with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus Iustitiam</hi>
                </foreign>: all three <lb/>
            are nought, and none can tell, which is worst, In <lb/>
            the first place I shall advise and wish yow in all <lb/>
            your Iudgementes to insist vpon the auncient wayes <lb/>
            of our co<ex>m</ex>mon lawe<del rend="strikethrough">s</del>: New opinions are many tymes <lb/>
            in a Counsellor retayned to defend a side: but they <lb/>
            stand not with the gravity of a Iudge; To invent <lb/>
            or finde out anything is com<ex>m</ex>endable in a Counsellor, <lb/>
            but lett a Iudge stand <foreign xml:lang="la">
                    <hi rend="italic">super antiquas vias</hi>
                </foreign>: For

                    <hi rend="italic">Lex loci et consuetudo Angliae</hi>
                </foreign> is all in all. One
            p<ex>ar</ex>ticuler more, which I thinck conduceth much to <lb/>
            Justice, to give all encouragement to the good and <lb/>
            expert Clarkes of this Court: It hath ever byn <lb/>
            the great com<ex>m</ex>endac<ex>i</ex>ons and honor of this Court to be <lb/>
            furnished with the best Clarkes: These encourage <lb/>
            others, reforme and reduce to the same purity of <lb/>
            pleading: which (as M<ex>aste</ex>r Littleton saith) is one of <lb/>
            the most honorable thinges of the lawe, And if a <lb/>
            man observe, what a multitude of Just causes <lb/>
            are overthrowne by vicious entries and pleadinges, <lb/>
            hee will have cause to beleeve it: And therefore, <lb/>
            as yo<ex>u</ex>r power is great to doe this, forgett not to <lb/>
            doe it. I know to whome I speake, yo<ex>u</ex>r great <lb/>
            vnderstanding and Iudgement, and that dexterity <lb/>
            in yow needes not, that I should say halfe this, and <lb/>
            yet, considering what order is, and the duty of my <lb/>
            place and affection to yo<ex>u</ex>r p<ex>er</ex>son, I could doe no lesse. <lb/>
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">I shall</fw>

            I shall shutt vpp all in twoe mementoes; the <lb/>
            one, the Iustices of this Court are stiled by <lb/>
            the name of Iusticiarij without addic<ex>i</ex>on, and the <lb/>
            processe likewise <foreign xml:lang="la">coram Iusticiarijs</foreign> without <lb/>
            addic<ex>i</ex>on: Addic<ex>i</ex>on for the most part diminishes. <lb/>
            That is an honor and somewhat more, in that it <lb/>
            hath byn more attributed to this Court, then any <lb/>
            other: Thinck on it, and lett it be an occasion <lb/>
            vnto yow to thinck what it is, and to followe it, <lb/>
            The next memento is to remember the catalogue <lb/>
            of yo<ex>u</ex>r predecessors, For I may be bould to say, <lb/>
            As many reverend men have byn vpon the <lb/>
            cushion in this Court, as ever satt in any, especially <lb/>
            the remembrance of the best is all the best <lb/>
            instrucc<ex>i</ex>on and lesson to yo<ex>u</ex>r selfe: Out of my <lb/>
            true and harty affecc<ex>i</ex>on to yow, I wish that <lb/>
            you may often thinck of them, and so thinck of <lb/>
            their wayes, that yo<ex>u</ex>r wayes may exceed and out=<lb break="no"/>
            runn the best of all./
