            satisfaction to his Holines Nuntio, who was desired to make one in <lb/>

            English, &amp; other Catholike projects, which might engender suspition &amp; <lb/>

            the time with severall complements, to severall persons, had nowe almost <lb/>

            </hi>people where you haue beene, first for theire soules (being heretikes) <lb/>
            then for theire estates, where the name of a Favorite is so familiar. <lb/>

            where the dore of Iustice &amp; Mercy stand equallie open to all men, without <lb/>

            entended as a by-blowe at the Nuntio, but fully at the duke of Lerma <lb/>
            (whose greatnes beganne nowe to waxe heavy towards declension) &amp;  <lb/>
            therefore he returned this answere. Yo<ex>u</ex>r Excellencie knoweth the <lb/>
            State is happie, where wise Favorites governe kings, if the kings <lb/>
            themselues be foolish; or where wise kings are who having Favorites. <lb/>
            whether foolish or of the wiser sorte, will not yet be governed by them. <lb/>
            The State of England (howsoever you heare of it in Spaine or Rome) <lb/>
            is too happie in the laste kinde. They neede not much care what the <lb/>

            suspition in that kinde, being rather chossen as a Scholler to be taught, <lb/>
            &amp; trayned vp, then as Tutor to teache) for of this they are sure; No <lb/>
            prince exceeds theires in personall abilities, so that nothing could be  <lb/>
            added to him in my wishe, but this one, that he were our vassaile &amp; <lb/>

            though some later then others. Envie had hung plummettes on them to  <lb/>
            keepe them downe, the Nuncio only sate vnmoved. The duke cherished <lb/>
            the observance of the reste, with a familiar kinde of carriage, too high for <lb/>
            Courtesie, as one not neglecting theire demeanors but expecting it, &amp;  <lb/>
            after a filiall obeysance to the Popes Nuncio, sate downe as president <lb/>

            given for admiration, preparation &amp; attention he beganne to speake <lb/>
            in this manner.			The king my Maister (holding it more <lb/>

            his Commande is confined within his owne Territories, &amp; he stiled <lb/>
            not Emperor of the world, but of the Turkes &amp; theire vassals only. <lb/>
            Anong <ex>Christ</ex>ians, the defender of the faith, was a glorious stile while <lb/>

            First it is well observed by the wisedome of our State, that the k<ex>ing</ex> <lb/>
            of Eng<ex>land</ex> (who otherwise is one of the most accomplishte princes that <lb/>

            I haue made triall of these particulers &amp; found fewe exceptions in <lb/>
            this generall rule.      Thereby I &amp; theire owne wants together haue <lb/>
            kepte the<ex>m</ex> from furnishing theire Navie, which being the walle of <lb/>

            riners as in other places. Therefore I cross’de whatsoever entendments <lb/>
            were projected for Virginia, or the Bermudaes, because I see they may <lb/>
            be hereafter reallie helpefull vnto them, as nowe they serve for draines <lb/>
            to vnloade theire populous state, which else would overflowe its owne <lb/>
            bankes by continuance of peace, &amp; turne heade vpon it selfe to make <lb/>
            a bodie fitte for any rebellion. 		And so farre haue I prevailed    <lb/>
            herein, as I caused most of the Recusants<del rend="strikethrough">,</del> who were sharers, to withdr<ex>aw</ex> <lb/>
            theire ventures &amp; to discourage the worke; so that besides private p<ex>er</ex>sons <lb/>
