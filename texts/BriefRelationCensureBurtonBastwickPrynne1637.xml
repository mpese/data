            I was shut vp Close Prisoner, that I could haue no accesse to Counsell nor admit <lb/>
            ted pen, inke or paper to draw vp my Answer by my Instructions, for which <lb/>
            I feed them twice (though to no purpose) Yet when all was done. my Answer <lb/>
            would not be accepted into the Court, though I tendred it vpon my Oath: I <lb/>
            appeale to all the world if this be a legall or iust proceeding: Our accasation <lb/>
            is in point of Libell (but supposedly) against the Prelates, To cleare this now <lb/>
            I will giue you a littel Light What the Law is in Point of libell (of which profes <lb/>
            Sion I haue sometimes beene, and still professe my Selfe to haue some knowledg in) <lb/>
            You shall finde in the Case of libell, two statutes, The one in the Second of Queen <lb/>
            Mary, The other in the Seuenth of Queen Elizabeth  That in <ex>th</ex>e Second of Qveen <lb/>
            Mary, the extremity &amp; h<add place="above">e</add>igh of it runs thus, That if a Libeller doth goe so farr <lb/>
            and so high as to libell against King or Qveen by denomination, the hig<add place="above">t</add>h &amp; <lb/>
            extremity of the Law is, that they lay no greater fine on him then an hundred <lb/>
            Pounds, with a monts imprisonment. &amp; no Corporall punishment except he <lb/>
            doe refuse to pay his fine, and then to inflict some punishment in liewe of <ex>tha</ex>t <lb/>
            fine at the months ende  Neither was this Censure to be passed on him <lb/>
            except it were fully prooued  by two witnesses, who were to produce a Certifi <lb/>
            Cate of their good demeanor for the Credit of their report, Or eles Confessed <lb/>
            by the Libeller, You shall find in <ex>tha</ex>t Statute 7 Eliza<ex>beth</ex> Some further adition <lb/>
            to the former of 2 Marie, and that onely in point of fine and punishment <lb/>
            and it must still reach as high as <ex>th</ex>e parson of King &amp; Qveene, Here this <lb/>
            Statude doth set a fine of two hundred pounds the other but one. This sets <lb/>
            three months imprisonment the former but one. So that therein onely they <lb/>
            differ, Bvt in this they both agree. Namely. at the end of his imprisonment <lb/>
            to pay his fine, and so to goe free without any further questioning<unclear>
                    <del rend="strikethrough">--</del>
                </unclear>: Bvt <lb/>
            if he refuse to pay his fine, then the Court is to inflict some Punishment <lb/>
            on him Correspondent to his fine, Now see the disparity between those times <lb/>
            of theirs and ours, A Libeller in Queen Maries das was fined but an hun <lb/>
            dred pounds, in Queene Elizabeths time two hundred  In Quene Maries <lb/>
            days but a months imprisonment, in Queene Elizabeth three months. &amp; <lb/>
            So grate a fine, if they libelled against King or Qveene, Formerly the <lb/>
            gratest fine was but two hundred Pounds though against Kinge or Qven <lb/>
            Now fiue thousand pounds, though but against the prelates and that <lb/>

            but Supposedly, which Cannot be prooued: Formerly but three moneths <lb/>
            imprisonment, Now perpetuall imprisonment: Then vpon paying <ex>th</ex>e <lb/>
            fine, no Corporall punishment was to be inflicted: But now infamous <lb/>
            Punishment with the Losse of blood and all other Circumtances <ex>tha</ex>t may <lb/>
            aggrauate it  See now what times we are fallen into, when <ex>tha</ex>t libelling <lb/>
            (if it were So) against Prelates onely. Shall fall higher, then if it touched <lb/>
            Kings or Princes

            That which I haue to speake of next is this: The Prelates find <lb/>

            Was not the Crosse more shamfull, yea and more painfull then a Pillary, <lb/>
            Was hee not stript of all he had, when he was left starke naked vpon <ex>th</ex>e <lb/>

            One sayd vnto Mr Bvrton, Christ will not be ashamed of you at <ex>th</ex>e Last day <lb/>
            Hee replied, Hee Knew whom hee had belieued, and that Christ was able <lb/>
            to keepe that he had Commited to him against that day, One asked him <lb/>
            how he did. Hee sayd, neuer better I blesse God, Who hath accounted mee <lb/>
            worthy thus to Svffer, The Keeper Keepeing off the People from pressing <lb/>
            neere the Pillary, hee sayd. Let them Come. &amp; spare not, that they may <lb/>
            Learne to Suffer. This same Keeper being weary, and sitting him down <lb/>
            asked Mr Bvrton. if he were well. and bad him be of good Comfort. To <lb/>
            whom he replyed  Are you well. If you be well, I am much more. and <lb/>
            full of Comfort, I blesse God. Some asked him, if the Pillary were not <lb/>
            vneasy for his neck and Shoulders, Hee answered. How can Christs yoake <lb/>
            be vneasy. This is Christs yoake and hee beares the heauier ende of it <lb/>
            and I the Lighter, and if mine were too heauy hee would beare <ex>tha</ex>t too <lb/>
            O good people, Christ is a good and sweet Master, and worthy <ex>th</ex>e Svffer <lb/>

            what a blessed thing it were to beare the yoake, O who would not beare it <lb/>
            The Keeper goeing about to ease the Pillary by putting a ston or a bricke <lb/>
            betweene Mr Bvrton sayd, Trouble not your Selfe. I am at very good ease <lb/>
            and feele no wearinesse at all. And espying a young man at the foote of <lb/>
            the Pillary, and perceiuing him to Looke pale on him, He sayd Sonn, <lb/>
            Sonne, what is the matter you loole so pale. I haue as much Comfort as <lb/>
            My heart Can hold, and if I had need of more I should haue it, One <lb/>
            asked him a while after, if he would drinke some Aquavite To whom <lb/>
            he replied, that he needed it not for I haue said he (Laying his hand <lb/>
            vpon his breast) the true water of life, Which Like a well doth spring <lb/>
            vp to eternall Life: Pawsing a while hee sayd with a most Cheerefull &amp; <lb/>

            know (Speaking to them that stood about him) What fruits God is able to <lb/>
            Produce from this dry tree, They Looking stedfastly vpon him: he sayd <lb/>

            I Say, remember it well, for this day will neuer be forgotten, and through <lb/>
            these holes (pointing to the Pillary) God Can bring light to his Church, The <lb/>
            Keeper going about againe to mend the Pillary, hee sayd: Doe not trouble <lb/>
            your selfe so much, Bvt indeed we are the troublers of the world, By and <lb/>
            by after, Some of them offering him a Cvp of wine. He thanked them tel <lb/>
            ling them. hee had the wine of Consolation within him, and the ioyes of <lb/>
            Christ in Possession which the world could not take away from him, neither <lb/>
            Could it giue them vnto him, Then he Looked towards the other Pillary, and <lb/>
            making a signe with his hand, Cheerfully Called to Dr Bastwicke &amp; Mr Prynne <lb/>
            asking them how they did, who answered, very well, A woman sayd vnto him <lb/>
            Sie, euery Christian is not worthy this honour, Which the Lord hath Cast vpon <lb/>
            you this day. Alas (sayd he) who is worthy of the Least mercy. Bvt it is his <lb/>
            gracious fauour and free gift, to account vs worthy in the behalfe of Christ <lb/>
            to suffer any thing for his Sake  Another woman sayd, There are many hundred <lb/>
            which by Gods assistance would willingly Svffer for the Cause you Svffer for this day <lb/>
            To whom he Sayd, Christs exalts all of vs that are ready to Svffer afflictions <lb/>
            for his Name with meekenes and patience, But Christs military discipline <lb/>
            in the vse of his Spirituall warfare in point of Svffering is quite forgotten <lb/>
            and we haue in a manner Lost the power of Religion, in not denying our <lb/>
            Selues and following Christ aswell in Svffering. as in doing  After a while <lb/>
            Mr Bvrton Calling to one of his frendes for an Handkercher, returned it <lb/>

            A Christian freind sayd to Mr Bvrton The Lord strngthen you, To whome <lb/>
            hee replied, I thanke you, and blesse his Name hee doth strengthen mee: For <lb/>
            though I am a poore Sinfull wretch: Yet I blesse God for my innocent Conscienc<add place="above">e</add> <lb/>

            shee was more Cheerefull of this day, then of her Wedding day. This answer <lb/>
            excedingly reioyced his heart, Who therevpon blessed God for her: and sayd <lb/>
            of her: Shee is  but a young Souldier of Christs, but shee hath already <lb/>
            endured many a sharpe brunt, but the Lord will strengthen her vnto <lb/>

            cerning that Svffering of shedding his blood, Hee answred What is <lb/>

            Mr Bvrton ouerhearing him answered, Why should there not be more <lb/>

            The people obseruing Mr Bvrtons Cheerefullnes and Courage in Svffering <lb/>

            Sayd as for this truth I haue preached, I am ready to seale it with my blood <lb/>
