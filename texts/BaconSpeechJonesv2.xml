            S<ex>i</ex>r William Iones The Kinges most excellent Maiesty	 <lb/>
            being truly informed of yo<ex>u</ex>r sufficiencie every way, <lb/>
            hath called yow by his writt now returned to the <lb/>
            state and degree of a Sergeant at lawe, but not to <lb/>
            stay there, but being so qualified, to serve him as his <lb/>
            cheife Iustice of his kinges Bench in Ireland, And <lb/>
            therefore, that which I shall say to yow must be <lb/>
            applyed, not to yo<ex>u</ex>r sergeantes place, which yow take, <lb/>
            but in passage, but to that great place, where you are <lb/>
            to settle, And because I will not spend tyme to the <lb/>
            delay of the busines of causes and hearinges, I will lead <lb/>
            yow the short iourney by examples, and not the long <lb/>
            by preceptes./
         </p>
         <p>
            The place, that yow shall serve in hath byn fortunate <lb/>
            to be well served in fower successions before yow, doe <lb/>
            but take vnto yow the constancy and integrity of S<ex>i</ex>r <lb/>
            Robert Gardiner, the gravity, temper and discrec<ex>i</ex>on <lb/>
            of S<ex>i</ex>r James Lee, the quicknes industry and dispatch <lb/>
            of S<ex>i</ex>r Humfry Winch, the care and affection to the <lb/>
            co<ex>m</ex>mon wealth, and the prudent and politique <lb/>
            administration of S<ex>i</ex>r John Denham, and yow shall need <lb/>
            no other lessons. They were all Lincolns Inne men, <lb/>
            as yow are: yow may have knowne then as well in their <lb/>

            yow are not to be their onely Cheife Iustice but a <lb/>
            Counsellor of Estate, I will putt yow in mynde of the <lb/>
            great worke now in hand, that yow may doe accordingly <lb/>
            vnto it./

         <p>
            Ireland is the last ex filijs Europe, which hath <lb/>
            come in, and hath byn reclaymed from desolation, and a <lb/>
            desert in many places to population and plantation, <lb/>
            and from salvage and barbarous customes to humanity <lb/>
            and civility. This is the kinges worke in cheife: It is <lb/>
            his garland of heroicall vertue and felicity denyed to <lb/>
            his progenitors, and reserved to his tymes. The worke <lb/>
            is not yet conducted to p<ex>er</ex>fection, but it is in fayre <lb/>
            advance, and this I will say confidently, That if <lb/>
            God blesse that kingdome with peace and Iustice <lb/>
            no vsurer is so sure in seven yeares space to double <lb/>
            his principall with interest and interest, as that <lb/>
            kingdome is within the same tyme to double the rest <lb/>
            and principall thereof, yea and p<ex>er</ex>happs to treble it, <lb/>
            So as that kingdome which once within theis twenty <lb/>
            yeares wise men were wont to doubt, whether they <lb/>
            should wish it to be in a Poole, is like now almost to <lb/>
            become a garden and a younger sister to great Brittaine, <lb/>
            And therefore yow must sett downe with yo<ex>u</ex>rselfe <lb/>
            not onely to be a iust governor, and a good cheife <lb/>
            Iustice, as if it were in England, but vnder the <lb/>
            King and the deputy, you are to be a maister <lb/>
            builder and maister planter and Reducer of <lb/>
            Ireland: To which end I will trouble you at this <lb/>
            tyme but with three directions./
         </p>
         <p>
            1: The first is, that yow have an especiall care of <lb/>
            the three plantac<ex>i</ex>ons, That of the North, which is <lb/>
            in part acted, that of wixford, which is now in <lb/>
            distraction, and that of long Efford and Kellam, <lb/>
            which is now in Survey. And take this from mee, <lb/>
            That the bane of a plantation is, when the vndertakers <lb/>
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">or planters</fw>
            <pb ed="Item 3" n="2r" facs="/nro/rye_20/rye_20-015/rye_20-015.jpg"/>
            or planters make such hast to a little Mechanicall <lb/>
            present profitt, as disturbeth the whole frame and <lb/>
            noblenes of the worke for the tyme to come, Therefore <lb/>
            hold them to their covenantes and the true ordinances of <lb/>
            a plantation./
         </p>
         <p>
            2: The second is, That yow be carefull of the kinges <lb/>
            Revennewe due, and by little and little constitute him a <lb/>
            good demeasne, which hitherto is little or none, and <lb/>
            the kinges case <del rend="strikethrough">is hardest</del> wilbe hardest, when <lb/>
            every mans land shalbe improved in value with <lb/>
            increase manyfold, the king shalbe tyed, to his <lb/>
            drye rent./
         </p>
         <p>
            3: My last direction, though first in weight is, that <lb/>
            you doe all good indeavors to proceed resolutely and <lb/>
            constantly and yet with due temperance and <lb/>
            equallity in matters of Religion, least Ireland <lb/>
            civill be worse to vs then Ireland savage./
         </p>
         <p>
            After S<ex>i</ex>r William Iones his speech <lb/>
            My Lord said./
         </p>
         <p>
            I had forgott one thing, which was this, yow may <lb/>
            take exceeding great comfort, that yow shall serve <lb/>
            with such a deputy, one that I thinck is a man <lb/>
            ordeyned of God to doe great good to that kingdome, <lb/>
            And this I thinck good to speake vnto yow, That the <lb/>
            true temper of a cheife Iustice towardes a deputy <lb/>
            is neither servilely to second him, nor factiously <lb/>
            to oppose him./
