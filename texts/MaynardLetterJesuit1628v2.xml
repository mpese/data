            w<ex>hi</ex>ch is By way of Imposic<ex>i</ex>ons, &amp; Excise; we instance The Low-countries, &amp; show <lb/>
            What a vast sum of mony they raise to pay their armies by sea &amp; land, <lb/>
            merely by excise. Then o<ex>u</ex>r Church-catholique p<ex>ro</ex>ceeds to show the meane how <lb/>
            to settle this excise, w<ex>hi</ex>ch must be By a mercinary Army of Horse, &amp; foot; for <lb/>
            the Hors, we haue made it sure y<ex>a</ex>t they shalbe forreners, &amp; Germans, who <lb/>
            will eate the Kings Revenue, &amp; spoile the Country wheresoever they come, <lb/>
            though they shold be well paid; w<ex>ha</ex>t havock will they make y<ex>e</ex>n, w<ex>he</ex>n they haue not <lb/>
            pay, or be not duly paid? surely they will do much more mischief y<ex>e</ex>n we <lb/>
            hope the Catholiques Army will doe. We are provident y<ex>a</ex>t this Mercanary Army <lb/>
            of 2000 Hors, &amp; 20000 foot shalbe taken into pay before the excise shalbe <lb/>
            setled. In forcing the excise, the Country is most likely to rise; if the Merci-<lb break="no"/>
