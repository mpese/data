            These I meddle not w<ex>i</ex>th because they were publicqely offered, and many <lb/>
            thowsand copies dispersed of them, and therfore I shall neede to give <lb/>
            noe reason for them, because they were free offers on his Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties p<ex>ar</ex>te of <lb/>
            his abundant grace, Wherefore there is noe reason to be given but his <lb/>
            own goodnes/.
