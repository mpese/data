                selfe have taken in Conformitie <lb/>
                to that Charge, that the king <lb/>
                may haue the honor of direction, <lb/>
                and the parte of obedience, wherby <lb/>

                shorter as it shall please God, and <lb/>
                the king Contracted into one hower, <lb/>
                and this I doe for three causes./
            </p>
            <p>
                First to give account to the king <lb/>
                of his Commaund./

            </p>
            <p>
                And Thirdly, that all men that <lb/>
                have to doe w<ex>i</ex>th the Chauncery, or the seale <lb/>
                may know what they shall expect <lb/>
                and both sett theire hartes and <lb/>
                myne Eares att Rest, not moveing <lb/>

                declaracon./
            </p>
            <p>
                And this I doe Allsoe under <lb/>
                three cautions./
            </p>
            <p>
                The first is that there be <lb/>
                some things of a more secrett and <lb/>
                Counsaylelike nature, w<ex>hi</ex>ch are <lb/>
                rather to be Acted then puplished <lb/>
                but those thinges w<ex>hi</ex>ch I shall
                <pb n="2r"/>
                speake of today, are of a more <lb/>
                puplique nature
            </p>
            <p>
                The second is That I will not <lb/>
                trouble this presence w<ex>i</ex>th every <lb/>
                perticular w<ex>hi</ex>ch would be too long, <lb/>
                but select those thinges w<ex>hi</ex>ch are of <lb/>
                greatest efficacie and conduce most <lb/>
                <foreign xml:lang="la">ad summas rerum</foreign> leaveing many oth<ex>e</ex>r <lb/>
                particulars to be sett downe in a <lb/>

                example of <add place="above">my last</add> pr<ex>e</ex>decessor in his <lb/>
                begini<ex>n</ex>gs.
            </p>
            <p>
                And lastly that theise Imperatives <lb/>
                w<ex>hi</ex>ch I have made but to my selfe <lb/>
                and my tymes be w<ex>i</ex>thout preiudice <lb/>
                to the Auhtoritie of the Courte, or <lb/>
                to wiser men that may succeede <lb/>
                me and chefely that they are <lb/>
                wholly <del rend="strikethrough">Ad</del>
                <add place="above">sub</add>mitted unto the greate <lb/>

                absolutest Prince for Judicature <lb/>

                <sic>wordle</sic>, for if of those thinges <lb/>
                w<ex>hi</ex>ch I intend to be subordinate to, <lb/>
                his directions shalbe thought by <lb/>
                his M<ex>ajes</ex>tie to be Inordinate, I shalbe <lb/>
                most readie to reforme them 
            </p>
            <p>
                Those thinges are but <foreign xml:lang="la">tanquam <lb/>

                noe flourishing or painted wordes <lb/>

                before deedes./
            </p>
            <p>
                The kinges Charge w<ex>hi</ex>ch is my <lb/>
                lanthorne resteth uppon fouer <lb/>
                heades. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first <add place="above">was</add> that I should
                <pb n="3r"/>
                Conteyne the Jurisdiccon of the <lb/>
                Courte, w<ex>i</ex>th<ex>i</ex>n the true, and due <lb/>
                limitts, w<ex>i</ex>thout swelling or excesse.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second that I should thinke <lb/>
                the putting of the great seale to <lb/>
                l<ex>ett</ex>res pattents was not a matter of <lb/>
                course to followe after precedent <lb/>
                warrants, but that I should take <lb/>
                it to be the Maturetie, and fulnes <lb/>
                of the kinges intencons, and therfore <lb/>
                one of the greatest partes of my <del rend="strikethrough">p</del>trust <lb/>
                and if I saw therein any scruple <lb/>
                or cause of stay that I should <lb/>
                acquaint him, w<ex>i</ex>th a <foreign xml:lang="la">quod non dubites <lb/>
                ne fecere</foreign>./
            </p>
            <p>
                The Third was that I should <lb/>
                retrench all unnecessary delayes that <lb/>
                the subiect might find that he <lb/>
                did enioye the same Remedy against <lb/>
                the fainting of the soule, and <lb/>
                the Consumption of his Estate <lb/>
                w<ex>hi</ex>ch: was speedie Justice./
            </p>
            <pb n="3v"/>
            <p>
                And that those same brambles <lb/>
                w<ex>hi</ex>ch grow about Justice of needlesse <lb/>
                charge and expence, and all <lb/>
                maner of exaccons might be rooted <lb/>
                out soe farre as might be
            </p>
            <p>
                Theise <hi rend="italic">Cammaundem<ex>en</ex>ts</hi> my Lords <lb/>
                are righteous, and as I may <lb/>
                terme them sacred, and therefore <lb/>
                to use a sacred forme, I pray <lb/>
                god blesse the king for his greate <lb/>
                care over the Justice of this land <lb/>
                and give me his poore servant <lb/>
                grace and power to observe <lb/>
                his precepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now for a beginning towardes it <lb/>
                I had sett downe, and applyed <lb/>
                particular orders to day out of <lb/>
                theise generall heades./
            </p>
            <p>
                For the excesse or humor of <lb/>
                the Courte of Chauncery, I shall <lb/>
                devide it into five Natures.

            <pb n="4r"/>
            <p>
                The <del rend="strikethrough">nature</del>
                <add place="above">first</add> is when the Courte <lb/>
                doeth embrace, or retayne causes <lb/>
                both in matter and in Circumstance <lb/>
                meerely determinable, and fitt for <lb/>
                the Common law, for my Lordes <lb/>
                the Chauncery is ordeyned to supply <lb/>
                the law, and not to subvert the law. <lb/>
                Now to describe unto yow: or delineate <lb/>
                what theise Causes are, and uppon <lb/>
                what difference, and what are fitt <lb/>
                for the Courte or not fitt for the <lb/>
                Courte were too long a lecture, <lb/>
                but I will tell yow:, what remedie <lb/>
                I have prepared, I will keepe <lb/>
                the keyes my selfe, and I will nev<ex>er</ex> <lb/>
                referre any demurrer or Plea <lb/>
                tending to dischardge or dismisse <lb/>
                the Courte of the Cause, to any <lb/>
                M<ex>aste</ex>r of the Chauncery, but Judge <lb/>
                of it my selfe, or at the least <lb/>
                by the M<ex>aste</ex>r of the Rolls, Nay <lb/>
                further I will appoynte regularly 
                <pb n="4v"/>
                that on the Tuesday of evry weeke <lb/>
                w<ex>hi</ex>ch: is the day of Ord<ex>e</ex>rs First to <lb/>

                may have his vale att the First w<ex>i</ex>thout <lb/>
                attending, and that the Courte <lb/>
                may not leave and accumulate a <lb/>
                Missellanie and Confusion of <lb/>
                Causes of all natures./
            </p>
            <p>
                The second point concerneth the <lb/>
                tyme of <add place="above">the</add> Complaint, and the late <lb/>
                Commers into the Chauncery w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>

                but I cannot tell what, but <add place="above">that</add> cause <lb/>
                the king hath settled according <lb/>
                to the auncient presidents in all <lb/>

                this I will say that the opinion not

                perishing of Infortunate subiects <lb/>
                and as the king found it well out <lb/>
                why should a man fly into the <lb/>
                Chauncery before he be hurte, but <lb/>
                my Lordes the power would be <lb/>
                preserved, but the practice would be <lb/>
                moderate, My Rule shalbe there fore <lb/>
                that In case of Complaints after <lb/>
                Judegement except the Judgm<ex>en</ex>t <lb/>

                in contempt of a preceding Order, <lb/>
                in this Courte, yea, and after <lb/>
