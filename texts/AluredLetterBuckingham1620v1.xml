   Spanish nation: The position of that Cuntrie, and ye disposition<lb/>
   of that people being (as it were) so malignant and ill agreeing<lb/>
   w<ex>i</ex>th vs The prince of the greatest parformance that euer this<lb/>
   kigedome had, was ye <hi rend="italic">Blacke</hi> prince. yet o<ex>u</ex>r chronicle records<lb/>
   That goeing into <hi rend="italic">Spaine</hi> to settle <hi rend="italic">Do Pedro</hi> in that kingdome,<lb/>
   besides the monstrous ingratituds &amp; p<ex>er</ex>fidiousnes of that <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi>,<lb/>
   who failed ye p<ex>er</ex>formance of those Condic<ex>i</ex>ons he had promised, w<ex>hi</ex>ch<lb/>
   caused the miserable revoulte in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, to the losse of our inheri<lb break="no"/>
   tance, ye prince was so poysoned in that Cuntrie, that he neuer<lb/>
   had his helth after. But to wind nearer to o<ex>u</ex>r purpose &amp;to our<lb/>
   times: w<ex>hi</ex>ch are little the better for our Spanish frendshipp <lb/>
   I beseech your Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>pp obserue, That all the marriages w<ex>it</ex>th the<lb/>
   heires and princes of this Crowne haue made in England these last<lb/>
   sixscore yeares, except the sev<ex>er</ex>all second marriages of <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> ye <hi rend="italic">8</hi>th:<lb/>
   haue beene only &amp; no wher els but w<ex>i</ex>th <hi rend="italic">Spaine</hi>, which how little<lb/>
   God hath blest the successe shewes. Prince Arthur maryed the<lb/>
   Spanish Kinges daughter, wee knowe that God tooke him awaie<lb/>
   sudainlie w<ex>i</ex>thin a smale time, and w<ex>i</ex>thout anie yssue. In a politique<lb/>
   respecte, wee would yet make a second match. So prince <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi>
                <lb/>
   (afterwards Kinge) marryed the same daughter. But <del>God</del> doubtlesse
   <pb n="27v"/>
   God was lesse pleased w<ex>i</ex>th that match w<ex>hi</ex>ch was lesse hpefull. And<lb/>
   therfore, God tooke awaie all the male children of it, &amp; left onlie a<lb/>
   daughter. In whose shorte Raigne, was shed more blood in the true<lb/>
   religion in six yeares, then for the falce in these 60 yeares. Wee made <lb/>
   then a third adventure and marriage w<ex>i</ex>th Spaine, queen <hi rend="italic">Marye</hi>
                <lb/>
   w<ex>i</ex>th Kinge <hi rend="italic">Phillip</hi>. which was so discontenting to the people, that yt<lb/>
   caused <hi rend="italic">Wyats</hi> rebellion; so discomfortable to the queene that it brake<lb/>
   her heart, being left and neglected of her husband; and so dishonor<lb break="no"/>
   able &amp; pr<ex>e</ex>iudiciall to this kingdome, that meerly for the Spaiards<lb/>
   sake wee haveinge noe difference at all w<ex>i</ex>th France, wee lost <hi rend="italic">Callice</hi> in<lb/>
   six daies, w<ex>hi</ex>ch had beene aboue 200 yeeres in our possession. Now if<lb/>
   I maie make bould to add rather then applie, and for observac<ex>i</ex>on<lb/>
   of the contrarie, rather then for imitac<ex>i</ex>on of ye <del>contrarie</del> presente<lb/>
   For though I have not so much iudgm<ex>e</ex>nt, nor so little witt to pr<ex>e</ex>sume to<lb/>
   advise, wher to match, yet I assume so much as to thinke a match<lb/>
   at home cannot be held anie wise inconvenient. Wee find that the<lb/>
   first and the laste of our Kinges that euer matched w<ex>i</ex>th ther Subiects<lb/>
   were <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> the 4th and <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> the 8th: from w<ex>hi</ex>ch two matches God<lb/>
   <add place="above">as it were</add> to shew ye lesse we rely vpon others abroad the more he will help vs<lb/>
   himselfe at home, gaue 2 daughters 2 <hi rend="italic">Elizabeths</hi> 2 such queenes,<lb/>
   then w<ex>hi</ex>ch ther was never two so blessed instruments of Gods glorie<lb/>
   and this kingdomes good by establishing peace in the land and religion<lb/>
   in the Church, vntill his Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties happie comeinge, who brought<lb/>
