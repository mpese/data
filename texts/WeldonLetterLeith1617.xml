            First for the Countrie I must confesse that it is too good for those that <lb/>

            inhabite it. The grounde might be made fruitfull had they witte <lb/>
            to manure it. Theire beastes be generallie small (women excep=<lb break="no"/>
            ted, of which there are no greater in the worlde. There is good <lb/>
            store of fowle; as fowle linnen, fowle houses, fowle dishes, fowle <lb/>
            pottes, fowle trenchers &amp; napkins, fowle sheetes &amp; shirtes, with w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>
            sorte of fowle we haue beene enforced to fare as the children of <lb/>
            Israel did with theire fowle in the Wildernes.	  They haue good <lb/>

            come once to theire handes it is worse then three dayes ould. For <lb/>
            theire butter &amp; theire cheese I will not meddle with it at this time, <lb/>
            nor any man I thinke at any time that loues his owne life. They <lb/>

            disproue it. I confesse all the deere that I haue mette with, was deere <lb/>
            lodging, deere horsemeate, deere Tobacco &amp; deere English beere. As for <lb/>
            Fruite, for theire grandmother <hi rend="italic">Euah </hi>her sake they never planted <lb/>
            any; &amp; for other trees, had Christ beene betrayed in this Country (which <lb/>

            tirednes &amp; silence, in that they will heare xx knockes before they <lb/>
            will answere one.   They persuade the Trumpeters that Fasting <lb/>
            is good for them, for emptines say they causeth winde, &amp; winde causeth <lb/>
            theire Trompets to sounde sweetly. The bringing of Here-haughts <lb/>
            they say was a needles charge, seeing they knowe theire piedegrees <lb/>
            well enough. &amp; the Harbingers might well haue beene spared since <lb/>
            they brought so many beddes with them. And of the two evills since the <lb/>

            &amp; the pore Harbingers keepe theire places &amp; doe theire office as <lb/>
            they returne. His Hangings they likewise desire to remaine there <lb/>
            to put them in minde of his Majestie.  They promise to dispense <lb/>
            with the woven Images, but for the graven Images in his newe <lb/>

            suppose god hath conceived against them for suffring such Idolatrie to <lb/>
            enter that kingdome. The Organes may finde merry because of <lb/>
            affinitye with theire Bag-pipes. The Skipper that brought <lb/>

            his Majestie was receiued into the Parish of Edenborough (for <lb/>
            a Citie I cannot call it) with greate showtes &amp; joyes, but with no <lb/>

            more welcome, which I believe, for he summoned but a Parliament <lb/>
            but Christ would haue summoned a Iudgment.  He was conveyed by <lb/>

            where the only bell they had, stoode vpon tip-toes to beholde his <lb/>
