            The way of Duells before
            the King. /
         </head>
         <p>
            When upon the exhibit of the Bill in Court before
            the Constable, the Appellant fayles in the
            proofe of his Appeale, and cannot by witnesse
            nor any other manner of way make the righte of
            his demaunde appeare, hee may offer to make
            proofe of his intent upon the defendant with his
            body by force, and if the defend<ex>an</ex>t will say, hee
            will so defend his honor, the Constable as
            Vicar Generall in Armes (for so is my
            Author) under the king hath power to ioyne
            this issue by battaile, and to assigne the tyme
            and place, so that it bee not within fortie dayes
            after the yssue in that manner ioyned, unlesse
            the agreement of the parties give themselves a
            shorter day; and upon the ioyning of the yssue by
            combate the Constable shall signifie to them
            their Armes, which are a Gauntlett and short
            sword, and a long sword and dagger, And then
            the Appellant and defendant shall both finde
            able pledges for their appearance at a certaine
            tyme, and a day sett, before the Sunne be come
            to some one degree certaynely named to acquitt
            their pledges, and the playntiff to make proofe of
            his charge, and the Applellee to make the best
            defence hee can for his honor, and that in the
            meane tyme neither of them by themselves, nor by
            any wellwillers of theirs shall lye in ambush to
            assault or worke any greivance to the other. /

         <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">The King</fw>
         <pb ed="Item 1" n="1v"/>
         <p>
            The King shall finde the feild for p<ex>er</ex>formance of
            the Duell, which must bee sixtie foote in length,
            and in breadth forty. It must be a hard and
            firme ground, nothing stony and listed about by
            the advise of the Marshall with good and
            serviceable Rayling. There must be twoe dores, the
            one in the east, and the other in the west, each of them
            of the height of seven foote or more, so that a horse
            cannot leape over them: And these dores are
            kept by the Serieant at Armes./ 
         </p>
         <p>
            The day of the battaile the King shall sitt in a
            Chaire mounted on a Scaffold, and a lowe seate
            shalbe made for the Constable and Marshall at
            the foote of the descent from the Scaffold; and
            sitting there, they demaund the pledges of the
            Appellant and defendant to come into the li<unclear>f</unclear>tes <lb/>
            and render them selves the Kinges prisoners,
            untill the Appellant and defendant are come
            in and made oath./
         </p>
         <p>
            When the Appellant comes to the feild, hee shall
            come to the dore in the East armed, and so
            appointed as the Court did order, and shall
            there attend the coming of the Constable to bring
            him in./
         </p>
         <p>
            And the Constable shall demaund of him, who
            hee is that comes thus armed to theise listes,
            what name hee beares, and the cause of his coming./ 
         </p>
         <p>
            The Appellant shall answeare I am such a man
            A: of B: Appellant, who am come mounted and
            armed as you see to the dore of these listes, to
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">demaund</fw>
            <pb ed="Item 1" n="2r"/>
            demaund an entrie, to make Endeavour to prove
            my intent against C: of D: and to acquitt my
            pledges./
         </p>
         <p>
            Then the Constable takeing upp his beaver, so assuring
            him selfe hee is the same p<ex>er</ex>son, who is the Appellant,
            shall throwe open the dore, and bidd him enter in his
            Armes with his victuales and other necessary attendance,
            and his Councell with him, and shall then bring him
            before the King, and thence to his seate, where hee
            shall attend untill the defend<ex>an</ex>t come./
         </p>
         <p>
            Then the Appellant shall make a request to the
            Constable and Marshall to discharge his pledges,
            And the Constable and Marshall shall informe his
            Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie that since the body of the Appellant is
            entred the listes to make proofe of his Appellee,
            his pledges by lawe ought to have a discharge,
            And after leave graunted by the king the
            Constable shall discharge them/
         </p>
         <p>
            If at the tyme appointed the defend<ex>an</ex>t comes
            not in to his defence, the King doeth com<ex>m</ex>aund
            the Constable to call him by the Marshall; and the
            Marshall shall com<ex>m</ex>aund the Livetenant; and the
            livetenant shall com<ex>m</ex>aund the Marshall of the
            herauldes of the South, if it be in the March of
            Clarenceux; and if the Marshall of the herauldes
            of the king of the South be not there, then a
            herauld of the March of King Clarenceux shall
            call him. And if the p<ex>er</ex>formance of the battailes
            be on the North side of the River of Trent, in
            the March of the King Norreyes, the Marshall
            of the king of the North shall demaund him, and
            in his default one of the herauldes of the March of
            king Norreyes shall call for the defend<ex>an</ex>t thus:
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">Oyes,</fw>

            yo<ex>u</ex>r pledges, in the presence of the King, Constable &amp;
            Marshall, and defend yo<ex>u</ex>r selfe against A: of B: in
            that hee shall question and charge thee./ 
         </p>
         <p>
            And if hee appeare not, hee shalbe in like manner
            thrice demaunded at the fower corners of the listes,
            onely at the second tyme hee is proclaimed, at the
            end the herauld shall say, the day is farr passed,
            So at the third tyme, the herauld at the halfe hower
            after three of the clock in the afternoone, by the
            com<ex>m</ex>aundement of the Constable, shall thus
            sum<ex>m</ex>on him.
         </p>
         <p>
            C: of D: defend<ex>an</ex>t, have your honor, and come into the
            Action, which you have undertaken at this day, the
            tyme is farr gon, the halfe hower is spent, come
            into the listes upon the perill, that shall followe
            thereon; or els you come too late./ 
         </p>
         <p>
            Then when they have both appeared the Register of
            the Constables Court shall in writing observe their
            entrance, the order and tyme, and the manner
            whether on foote, or mounted, their Armes, the
            colour of their horses, and how their horses are
            harnished, least their horses or their harnish shold
            be changed or otherwise imbeazelled. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Then the Constable shall knowe whether it will
            please the kinges Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie to appoint any of his
            Nobles to councell and advise them. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The Constable shall imploy twoe knightes or
            esquires to the Appellant to keepe his standing,
            and to care, that hee observe no charme, spell, or
            <fw type="catch" place="bot-right">other</fw>

            other ill Artes untill hee hath made oath, and
            with the like charge twoe others shalbe dispatched
            to the defend<ex>an</ex>t./
         </p>
         <p>
            And when the Constable hath asked his Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties
            pleasure, whether his highnes will receive their
            oathes in p<ex>er</ex>son, or that the Constable and Marshall
            take them in the listes, calling for the Appellant
            with his Councell, shall demaund of the Councell,
            if they will make any further protestation, that
            they should now putt them in, for this tyme is
            peremptory, so as hereafter no protestac<ex>i</ex>on
            shalbe received./
         </p>
         <p>
            Then the Constable shall have a Clarke ready by
            him with a booke, and the Constable shall cause
            his Register to <del rend="strikethrough">cause</del> read the whole bill to the
            Appellant, and shall say to him.

            You A: of B doe you knowe this to be yo<ex>u</ex>r bill, &amp;
            the Complaynt, which you exhibited in Court before
            me? laying your right hand upon this Booke, you
            must sweare the truth of yo<ex>u</ex>r Bill in all pointes
            from the first to the last charge in it: and
            that it is your intent to prove upon C: of D the

         <p>
            The forme of it is thus: Thou A of B: this
            thy Bill is sooth in all pointes and Articles
            conteyned therein, from the begining to the end;
            and it is thyne intent to prove them this day so

         <p>
            And this their first oath they ought to take
            kneeling, but by the favour of the Constable &amp;
            Marshall they sometymes doe it standing./

         <p>
            Then the Constable shall by the Marshall call

            Then being conducted to his place the keepersof

         <p>
            I charge you A of B: Appellant by yo<ex>u</ex>r faith,
