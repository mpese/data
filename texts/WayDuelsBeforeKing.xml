         <p>
            When upon the exhibit of the Bill in Court before <lb/>
            the Constable, the Appellant fayles in the <lb/>
            proofe of his Appeale, and cannot by witnesse <lb/>
            nor any other manner of way make the righte of <lb/>
            his demaundes appeare, hee may offer to make <lb/>
            proofe of his intent vpon the defendant with his <lb/>
            body by force, and if the defend<ex>an</ex>t will say, hee <lb/>
            will so defend his honor, the Constable as <lb/>
            Vicar Generall in Armes (for so is my <lb/>
            Author) vnder the king hath power to ioyne <lb/>
            this issue by battaile, and to assigne the tyme <lb/>
            and place, so that it bee not within fortie dayes <lb/>

            the agreament of the parties give themselves a <lb/>
            shorter day; and vpon the ioyning of the yssue by <lb/>
            combate the Constable shall signifie to them <lb/>
            their Armes, which are a Gauntlett and short <lb/>
            sword, and a long sword and dagger, And then <lb/>
            the Appellant and defendant shall both finde <lb/>
            able pledges for their appearance at a certaine <lb/>
            tyme, and a day sett, before the Sunne be come <lb/>
            to some one degree certaynely named to acquitt <lb/>
            their pledges, and the playntiff to make proofe of <lb/>
            his charge, and the Applellee to make the best <lb/>
            defence hee can for his honor, and that in the <lb/>
            meane tyme neither of them by themselves, nor by <lb/>
            any wellwillers of theirs shall lye in ambush to <lb/>
            assault or worke any greivance to the other. /

            The King shall finde the feild for p<ex>er</ex>formance of <lb/>
            the <hi rend="italic">Duell</hi>, which must bee sixtie foote in length,

            firme ground, nothing stony and listed about by <lb/>
            the advise of the Marshall with good and <lb/>
            serviceable Rayling. There must be twoe dores, the <lb/>
            one in the east, and the other in the west, each of them <lb/>
            of the height of seven foote or more, so that a horse <lb/>
            cannot leape over them: And these dores are <lb/>
            kept by the Serieant at Armes./ 
         </p>
         <p>
            The day of the battaile the King shall sitt in a <lb/>
            Chaire mounted on a Scaffold, and a lowe seate <lb/>
            shalbe made for the Constable and Marshall at <lb/>
            the foote of the descent from the Scaffold; and <lb/>
            sitting there, they demaund the pledges of the <lb/>
            Appellant and defendant to come into the listes <lb/>
            and render them selves the Kinges prisoners, <lb/>

         <p>
            When the Appellant comes to the feild, hee shall <lb/>
            come to the dore in the East armed, and so <lb/>
            appointed as the Court did order, and shall <lb/>
            there attend the coming of the Constable to bring <lb/>
            him in./

         <p>
            And the Constable shall demaund of him, who <lb/>
            hee is that comes thus armed to theise listes, <lb/>
            what name hee beares, and the cause of his coming./

         <p>
            The Appellant shall answeare I am such a man <lb/>
            A: of B: Appellant, who am come mounted and <lb/>
            armed as you see to the dore of these listes, to

            Then the Constable takeing vpp his beaver, so assuring <lb/>
            him selfe hee is the same p<ex>er</ex>son, who is the Appellant, <lb/>
            shall throwe open the dore, and bidd him enter in his <lb/>
            Armes with his victualles and other necessary attendance, <lb/>
            and his Councell with him, and shall then bring him <lb/>
            before the King, and thence to his seate, where hee <lb/>
            shall attend untill the defend<ex>an</ex>t come/
         </p>
         <p>
            Then the Appellant shall make a request to the <lb/>

            entred the listes to make proofe of his Appellee,
            his pledges by lawe ought to have a discharge,
            And after leave graunted by the king the <lb/>
            Constable shall discharge them/

         <p>
            If at the tyme appointed the defend<ex>an</ex>t comes <lb/>
            not in to his defence, the King doeth com<ex>m</ex>aund <lb/>
