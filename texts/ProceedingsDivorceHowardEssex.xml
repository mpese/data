            my mayne answer is that we must distinguish of tymes <lb/>

            vpon the church and before that the Empyre became <lb/>
            Christian the church did not meddle with questions of <lb/>
            marriage for the ciuell Iudges determined them who <lb/>
            would not suffer the church to medle with any thinge that <lb/>
            drew a consequence after it of possession &amp; inheritance as <lb/>
            marriage doth. nay euen diuers hundred yeares after the <lb/>
            conuersion of the emperor the iudgement &amp; descission of <lb/>
            all such questions did still remayne <foreign xml:lang="la">in foro ciuili</foreign>. till the <lb/>

            to her selfe a supreme &amp; independent iudicature in all <lb/>
            eclesiasticall causes. &amp; therefore the fathers &amp; councellors <lb/>
            had noe occasion to make mension of that which was not <foreign xml:lang="la">eorum <lb/>
            fore</foreign> at that tyme. &amp; besides it is <choice>
