            saide it was the 8th. daye p<ex>re</ex>ferring to haue left them, vntil hee <lb/>

            Courage and patience concealed the same, his highnes beinge <lb/>

            Median of his right Arme 7: or 8: ounces of Bloude, duringe <lb/>

            and calling to them to take more, as they were about to stop the <lb/>
            same, finding some ease as it were vpon the Instant, The bloud being <lb/>

            to A more gentle motion, missing his former wonted cruell doub=<lb break="no"/>
            lings, and his former Accidents being lesse and more mylde, This <lb/>
            after noone he was visited by his Father Mother Brother Sister <lb/>
            the Palsgrave, w<ex>i</ex>th divers others of the Courtes, All w<ex>hi</ex>ch Co<ex>n</ex>ceaving <lb/>

            night (thoughe better then others passed vnquiettlye/
         </p>
         <p>
            On Mundaye the Second of November and 9th of his sicknes, <lb/>
            he became worse then ever, <ex>th</ex>e great redoubling Coming vpo<ex>n</ex> him <lb/>
            accompanied w<ex>i</ex>th rednes of Face, Shortnes of Breathe, increase <lb/>
            of drought, blacknes of his toung w<ex>i</ex>th excessiue heate some what <lb/>
            lesse then it was the 7th. daye, and benum<ex>m</ex>ings w<ex>hi</ex>ch nowe with the <lb/>
            increase of all the Former Accidents tormented him, Breiflye <lb/>
            soe many evell signes appeared that some of the doctors then <lb/>
            plainely affirmed that by violence of the desease the bloud and <lb/>
            humors weare retyred in aboundance w<ex>i</ex>th greate violence towards <lb/>
            the braine, filling the braynes aboundantlye, as afterwardes in the <lb/>
            opening did appeare, by reason whereof the paine in the head was <lb/>
            extreame greate, his Spirretts being as it were overcome/ This <lb/>

            practise, honestie and learning, was sent by his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tye to assist <lb/>

            sease was A Corrupte purred Feavour the heate whereof was vnd<ex>e</ex>r <lb/>
            the liver in the first passages, the malignetie whereof he thought <lb/>
            by reason of the putrifaction in allmost the highest degree, was  <lb/>
            venemous, This daye and the next he was visited by the Kinge, <lb/>
            his Father, and others of the Courte, whose exceeding sorrowe I <lb/>
            cannot exprese: yett were they still fed w<ex>i</ex>th some small hopes <lb/>
            of his Recou<ex>er</ex>ye, All this while, allthoughe he grewe everye daye <lb/>
            worse and worse, yet none discouraged him w<ex>i</ex>th anye speeches <lb/>
            of deathe, Soe loathe they were to thinke of his dep<ex>ar</ex>ture, himselfe <lb/>
            being soe tormented w<ex>i</ex>th this and the next dayes sicknes that he <lb/>
            could not thinke thereof, Or if  had yet the Phisicons Courage, <lb/>
            and hope of liffe, w<ex>hi</ex>ch good opinion his vnspeakable patience not <lb/>
            anye waye co<ex>m</ex>playning, Soe that he could not have bine knowne to be <lb/>
            sicke but by his lookes, moved them to conceave, Therefore telling <lb/>
            him there was noe daunger dashed the same, This night came vpo<ex>n</ex> <lb/>
            him greate alienac<ex>i</ex>on of braine ravinge, and idle speeches out of <lb/>
            purpose: Calling for his Clothes and Rapier, and saying he must <lb/>
            be gone, he could not staye, and I knowe not what elce, To the great <lb/>
            greiffe of all <ex>tha</ex>t heard him, whose hopes now began to vanish/
         </p>
         <p>
            On Tewsdaye the Third of the Monthe, and tenthe of his sicknes <lb/>
            he became worse then before, All his former Accidents increasing <lb/>
            exceedinglye, his boundings being turned into Convultions, his <lb/>
            ravinge and benu<ex>m</ex>ing greater, the Feavour more violent, wherevpo<ex>n</ex> <lb/>
            bleeding was agayne p<ex>ro</ex>posed by doctor Mayorne &amp; <ex>th</ex>e Favourers <lb/>
            thereof, whoe still affirmed that he did mislike the two Sparinge <lb/>
            p<ex>ro</ex>ceeding w<ex>i</ex>th his highnes, alleadging that in this case of extremity, <lb/>
            they must (if they mente to saue his liffe) p<ex>ro</ex>ceed in the Cure as if  <lb/>
            it were to some meane p<ex>er</ex>son, forgetting him to be A Prince who<ex>m</ex> <lb/>
            they had nowe in hande, otherwise he said for ought he sawe, because <lb/>
             he was A Prince he must dye, but if he weare A meane p<ex>er</ex>son he might <lb/>
            be saved, but this his opinion being disallowed of most they co<ex>n</ex>tynued <lb/>
            and increased their Cordialls giving vnto him A Glister which <lb/>
            brought awaye aboundance of Corrupte and putred matt<ex>e</ex>r togith<ex>e</ex>r <lb/>
            w<ex>i</ex>th some reasons w<ex>hi</ex>ch (as was thought) he had eaten 12 dayes before <lb/>
            This daye allsoe for the easing of the extreame paine of his head, <lb/>
            the hayre was shaven awaye, and pigeons applyed to lessen and <lb/>
