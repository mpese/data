            that turned over the bowels of those there p<ex>re</ex>sent with greiffe &amp; <lb/>

            he might haue repented / and Christ would haue receaued him to mercye <lb/>

            much esteeme of him / as to honor him / w<ex>i</ex>th the degree of Apostle &amp; <lb/>
            did maineteyne and feed him / he au<ex>n</ex>swered Christ did allsoe feede and <lb/>

            then to be in his p<ex>resen</ex>ce by the illuminac<ex>i</ex>on of the holye Spirritt / &amp; besides <lb/>
            I denye that even Iudas could haue repented / howe long soe eu<ex>er</ex> he <lb/>

            Oh Spira saide they you know you are in a Spirrituall disserc<ex>i</ex>on <lb/>

            my harte / all good motions and inclinat<ex>i</ex>ons are nowe quite gone / <lb/>
            my harte is full of maledic<ex>i</ex>on hatred and blasphemie against God <lb/>
            I finde I growe more and more hardened in harte / and cannot <del rend="strikethrough">hep <lb/>

            the table / to w<ex>hi</ex>ch he runned hastilye catched hold of it as intending <lb/>
            to mischeiffe himselfe / but his Friends laying hold of him stopped <lb/>
            him in his purpose / wherevpon in Indignac<ex>i</ex>on he saide / I woulde <lb/>
            I were above God for I knowe he will haue noe mercie on mee /

            Thus went he homewards sayinge often that hee Envied <lb/>
            the Condic<ex>i</ex>on of Caine and Iudas / he lay about 8: weekes in <lb/>
            this case in continuall burning / neither desiring nor receaving any <lb/>
            thinge but by Force / and that w<ex>i</ex>thout disgestio<ex>n</ex> / Soe spent he appeared <lb/>
            A perfect Anatomye / expressing to the veiwe nothinge but <lb/>
            veines and synewes / vehementlye rageing for drinke / and pineing <lb/>
            yet fearing to live longe / dreadful of Hell / yet coveting deathe / <lb/>
            in continuall Torment / yet his owne Tormentor / and thus co<ex>n</ex>suming <lb/>
            himselfe w<ex>i</ex>th greiff / horror / impatience / and dispayre / living A <lb/>
            liuinge Man in hell / hee rep<ex>re</ex>sented an extraordinary exaple <lb/>
            of the Iustice and Power of God / Thus (as farre as appeareth) <lb/>
            within fewe dayes after his arrivall at his owne home he dep<ex>ar</ex>ted <lb/>
            this pr<ex>e</ex>sent liffe /
