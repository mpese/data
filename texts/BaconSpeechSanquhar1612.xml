            In this Cause if life, and death, the <lb/>
            Iuryes parte is in effect discharged: For <lb/>
            after a Francke, and Formall Confession, <lb/>
            their labor is att an End, soe that what hath bin <lb/>
            sayed by Mr Attornye generall, or shalbe sayd <lb/>
            by my self, is Rather Conuenyent, then <del rend="strikethrough">necesssitie</del> <add place="above">necessary</add>./

         <p>
            My Lord Sanquer yo<ex>u</ex>r faulte is <lb/>
            great it cannot be Extenuated, and it neede <lb/>
            not be aggrauated, and If needed you haue <del rend="strikethrough">had</del> <lb/>
            made soe full an Anatomy of it out of yo<ex>u</ex>r <lb/>
            owne feelinge, as it cannot be matched by <lb/>
            my self, or anie man Ells out of my conceipt./.
         </p>
         <p>
            This Christian, and Penitent Course <lb/>
            of yo<ex>u</ex>rs drawes me thus farre, that I agree, that <lb/>
            as euen in Extreame Euills, there are de<lb break="no"/>
            grees, soe this instance of yo<ex>u</ex>r offence is <lb/>
            not of the highest straine, For If you <lb/>
            had sought to take away a mans life, For <lb/>
            his vyneyard as Ahab did or for Enuye <lb/>
            as Cayne did or to possesse his bedd, as <lb/>
            Dauid did suerly the offence had bin more <lb/>
            odious/.
         </p>
         <p>
            Your temptac<ex>i</ex>on was Reuenge, w<ex>hi</ex>ch the <lb/>
           more naturall it is to Man, the more haue lawes <lb/>

           shall neuer agree, that generous spiritts (you <lb/>
           say) are hard to forgiue, noe Contrariwise <lb/>
           generous, and in magnanimous mindes are <lb/>
           readiest to forgiue, and it is a weakenes and <lb/>
           Impotencie of minde to be vnable to forgiue./
         </p>
         <p>
            But to the purpose howsoeuer Murther <lb/>
            may arise from seuerall motiues lesse, or more <lb/>
            odious, yet the lawe both of god, and man; Inuolues <lb/>
            them in one degree and therefore you may reade <lb/>
            that in Ioabs Case w<ex>hi</ex>ch was a Murther <lb/>
            upon reuenge, and matched with your Case <lb/>
            hee for a deare Brother, and you For a <lb/>

         <p>
            And Certainely the Circumstance of tyme <lb/>
            is heauie vnto you it is now Fiue yeares since, <lb/>

            to haue bin the gall of bitternes soe longe, and <lb/>
            to haue bin in a Restles Case of his blood; is a straunge <lb/>
            Example, And I must tell you plainelie that I <lb/>
            conceaue you haue suckt those Affecc<ex>i</ex>ons of <lb/>
            dwellinge in malice rather out of Italye, and <lb/>

            England, or Scotland./.
         </p>
         <p>
            But now further my Lord, I would <lb/>
            haue you looke a little upon this offence, in <lb/>
            the glasse of godes Iudgement, that god maye <lb/>
            haue the glorye you haue Frendes, and En<lb break="no"/>
            tertaynementt in Forragine parts it had <lb/>
            bin an Easie thinge for you to haue sett <lb/>
            Carlile, or some other Bloodhound, on worke <lb/>
            when yo<ex>u</ex>r person had bin beyond the Seas <lb/>
            and soe this newes might haue Come to <lb/>
            you in a Parquett; And you might haue <lb/>
            looked on; how the storme would passe But <lb/>
            god bereaued you of this Prouidence, and <lb/>
            Bound you heere, vnder the hand of a kinge <lb/>
            that though Abundant in Clemencye, yet is <lb/>
            noe lesse zealous of Iustice./.
         </p>
         <p>
            Againe when you came in att
            <pb n="36v"/>
            Lambeth, you might haue persisted in the <lb/>
            denyall of the Procurement of the Facte, <lb/>
            Carlyle, a Resolute Man, might haue cleared <lb/>
            you, for they that are resolute in Mischeife <lb/>
            are Co<ex>m</ex>monly obstinate in Concealinge their <lb/>
            procurors; And soe noethinge should haue <lb/>
            bin against you but Presumpc<ex>i</ex>on; But then <lb/>
            God to take awaie all obstruction of Iustice, <lb/>
            gaue you the grace (w<ex>hi</ex>ch ought indeed to be <lb/>
            more true comfort vnto you then any Euasion, <lb/>
            or deuise whreby you mought haue escaped to <lb/>
            make a cleare Confession./.
         </p>
         <p>
            Other Impediments there were not a <lb/>

         <p>
            But now that I haue giuen God <lb/>
            the honnor lett me giue it where it is next due <lb/>

            This Murther was noe sooner Com<lb break="no"/>

            Iust Indignation wherewith att the first he was <lb/>

            of Care, and prouidence to haue Iustice done <lb/>
            First came forth his proclamac<ex>i</ex>on somewhat of
            <pb n="37r"/>
            a rare Forme, and deuise, and in Effect di<lb break="no"/>
            rected by his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie himself, and <del rend="strikethrough">by</del> that he did <lb/>
            prosecute the offendors as it were with breath <lb/>
            and blastes of his Mouth; Then did his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie <lb/>
            stretch forth his longe Armes (for kinges you <lb/>
            knowe haue longe Armes) one of them to the <lb/>
            Sea where he tooke hold of Gray shipped for <lb/>
            Sweden; who gaue the first light of Testi<lb break="no"/>
            monie, The other Arme to Scotland and there <lb/>
            tooke hold of Carlisle ere he was warme in <lb/>
            his house, and brought him the length of this <lb/>
            kingdome vnder such safe watchm and Custody <lb/>
            as he could haue noe meanes to escape; or to <lb/>
            mischeefe himself nor learne noe lessons to stand <lb/>
            mute; In w<ex>hi</ex>ch Cases perhaps theis dayes <lb/>
            Iustice might haue receaued a stopp, soe that <lb/>
            I may conclude his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie hath shewed <lb/>
            himselfe gods true liefte<ex>na</ex>nt and that he is <lb/>
