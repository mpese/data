            the word Gouerment, in the first clause, and in the third clause of the oath be to <lb/>
            be taken in the same sence? And whether thereby be meant the species of <lb/>
            gouernours as seemeth to be imported in the latter clause, by the inumeration <lb/>
            of some of them with an &amp;c? or 2dly the lawes and rules of gouerment, vix <lb/>
            Rubrick &amp; Canons Canon Law, and Civil law still in force (though some <lb/>
