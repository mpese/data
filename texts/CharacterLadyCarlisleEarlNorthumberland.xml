         <p>
            Hee, is naturallye, a kynde of Inward, and <lb/>
            reserved Man, and hee doth not easelye make the <lb/>
            world such playe, As to open him selfe, wthout <lb/>
            much Observac<ex>i</ex>on<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> of their Judgmt<ex>es</ex>: though since <lb/>
            his Condic<ex>i</ex>on hath produced, and Planted him, in <lb/>
            the waye of the world, hee is ffounde to bee <lb/>
            <ex>RM: x</ex> noe such Witch <lb/>
            Eyther this Man, is very worthie, or such, as <lb/>
            knowe him best, are deceyved most; ffor they <lb/>
            whoie haue beheld him w<ex>i</ex>th more Curiositye; <lb/>
            and Care, then w<ex>i</ex>th partiallitye, and purpose <lb/>
            to gyve Applause, haue ffounde much in him, <lb/>
            to prayse, and not soe much, as a little to reprove;
         </p>
         <p>
            This: is soe true; that a Man, whom<ex>m</ex>e I Love, <lb/>
            as my selfe; is wonte to saye of this Person<ex>n</ex>, that <lb/>
            hee hath but one quarrell to him, w<ex>hi</ex>ch is, that <lb/>
            hee cann ffinde noethinge in him, to fforgive. <lb/>
            But, yett, I knowe not whether I am<ex>m</ex>e ffullye <lb/>
            of that mynde, or noe, ffor I Confesse, I <lb/>
            haue layde upp: a kynde of Quere, Concerninge <lb/>
            him, w<ex>hi</ex>ch  I keepe wholie to my selfe, and meane <lb/>

            wth:<pb n="241v"/>
            wth it, As I thincke hee should (though I meane to <lb/>
            leave the Circumstau<ex>n</ex>ces  of tyme, and place to him <lb/>
            selfe, it will lessen him much, in som<ex>m</ex>e respect<ex>es</ex>, wth <lb/>
            mee.
         </p>
         <p>
            I: hould the ffacultye of his mynde, to bee verye <lb/>

            His Speeche is slowe, and it deserves a Pardon<ex>n</ex> <lb/>
            of Course, ffor many Reason<ex>n</ex>s: <lb/>
            ffor hee never speakes by Chaunce, never uppon <lb/>

            shewe, that hee is a verye Temperate, and prudent <lb/>
            Man, And indeed, hee never seemes, soe much, as <lb/>
            to open his Mouth, towardes speech, tyll hee haue <lb/>
            ffirst asked Leave, and Councell, of his hart; <lb/>
            His Apprehension<ex>n</ex> is verye readye; and his Judgmte <lb/>
            certainlye sound, And all his Acc<ex>i</ex>ons, are such, As <lb/>
            not to ffeare a Censure; not to desire a Corner <lb/>
            But to bidd Men looke on, and doe their worst:
