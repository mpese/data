            Nexte the book wantes the approbation of the gen<ex>er</ex>all Assembly the only Representative <lb/>
            churche w<ex>i</ex>thin the Realme, w<ex>hi</ex>ch hath power to directe Synodes, Presbiters, p<ex>ar</ex>ticular <lb/>
            churches and p<ex>er</ex>sons in matters of religion: As if wee should receave a thinge <lb/>
            as indifferente, and all other reiecte yt as popishe, what will followe therby <lb/>
            but horrible confusion and schisme: And are not they schismatick whoe bringe <lb/>
            in and practise novelties in a churche w<ex>i</ex>thout the warrante and approbacio<ex>n</ex> <lb/>
            of the churche?

         <p>
            Yf yt bee alleaged that there bee no appearances of any true and righte constitute <lb/>
            Assemblies. It is answered that the same may bee had yf it please the vrgers <lb/>
            of the book to procure and graunte yt: Let the blame therfore lighte upon them. <lb/>
            Then suppose that both he generalll assemblies and p<ex>ar</ex>liam<ex>en</ex>t had approved the book <lb/>
            and enioyned the practise of the formes in yt (w<ex>hi</ex>ch wee trust they shall never doe) <lb/>
            yet wee shoulde not receave yt. First because there is much popishe matter <lb/>
            in the wordes and there is conteyned in the book Mattins and Evensonges, and <lb/>
            Canonicall service ordayned to bee p<ex>er</ex>formed by the minister and Deacon as the <lb/>
            rep<ex>re</ex>sentatiue prayers of the churche, to stande in steede of prayers even when wee <lb/>
            are absente and p<ex>er</ex>haps sleepinge. Wee haue also here the <unclear>undereyte</unclear> formes <lb/>
            of churchinge of women, the rynge of marriage layde upon the book w<ex>i</ex>th other <lb/>
            ridiculous toyes and speeches. Matriomony is used as a Sacram<ex>en</ex>t wee must <lb/>
            haue a Fonte at the entry of the Churche, and the water consecrated in the Fonte <lb/>
            and twise in the moneth chaunged. The baptised infante must bee signed <lb/>
            w<ex>i</ex>th the signe of the crosse, and interrogatories must bee demaunded in the Infantes <lb/>
            name w<ex>hi</ex>ch is also most ridiculous. Baptisme profaned in private. younge <lb/>
            children assoone as they cann reherse any p<ex>ar</ex>ticular Catechisme must bee Bishopped. <lb/>
            The Com<ex>m</ex>union must bee receaved in private yf the partie disseased require the <lb/>
            same: It shalbee administred to three or four in the Churche accordinge to the desire <lb/>
            of such as woulde haue yt. Wee haue here the Idolatrous gesture of the com<ex>m</ex>unicante <lb/>
            in the acte of receavinge ratified. Wee haue also a masse p<ex>ro</ex>cedinge the com<ex/>u=<lb break="no"/>
            nion, although wee haue yt not w<ex>i</ex>th all the businesse and Ceremonies yet wee <lb/>
            haue the essence and substance of the sacrifice; For in the prayer of consecration the <lb/>
            minister must pray that God will so blesse and sanctifie the elementes of the <lb/>
            breade and wyne w<ex>i</ex>th his holy Spirit <hi rend="underline">that they may bee unto us the very body <lb/>
            and bloode of Chr<ex>ist</ex> in w<ex>hi</ex>ch</hi> wordes there is strangely couched Transubstantiation./
         </p>
         <p>
            The wordes of Institution att the consecration must bee uttered unto God as the Prieste <lb/>
            doth in the sacrifice of the Masse and not unto the Com<ex>m</ex>unicantes. The Ministers must <lb/>
            first receave because hee must as Prieste first consume the sacrifice before the <unclear>feaste</unclear> <lb/> 
            the Com<hi>m</hi>unicantes. Wee haue here also integrall pointes of the oblation before the <lb/>
            consecration, and a memoriall or prayer after the oblation ymediatly. Wee <lb/>
            haue also some accidentall rites and ceremonies of the Masse, althoughe not <lb/>
            w<ex>i</ex>th all the businesse. <hi rend="underline">The standinge of the Laver in the Quyre</hi>. The minister <lb/>
            some tymes kneelinge, sometymes standinge, some tyme turninge to the people <lb/>
            and sometymes to the Table. <hi rend="underline">Wee haue here also aulter clothes as the Corporall</hi> <lb/>

            Wherfore, whatsoever hirelinge shall embrace this book hee shalbee turned into a masse- <lb/>
            prieste, and whosoever doth countenance such com<ex>m</ex>union doth countenance a masse.
         </p>
         <p>
            Wee haue also a greate nomber of Festivals dayes and sett feastes. And it woulde <lb/>
            bee to prolixe to pointe out all the <unclear>trashe</unclear> and trumpery of the book.
         </p>
         <p>
            Againe suppose there were noe faulte in the matter yet there is error in the <lb/>
            formes and orders: For some formes are here p<ex>re</ex>scribed that are used in the <lb/>
            popishe Churche and in the same termes: And wee oughte not to conforme in <lb/>
            termes of publique worshippe w<ex>i</ex>th Antichristian synagoges, nor to bee tyed to <lb/>
            there termes and phrases, yf our Churche bee not a member of ther churche <lb/>
            seinge wee may use and haue used better formes./
         </p>
         <p>
            Here wee haue Gospells and Epistles appropriated to sett tymes and dayes or=<lb break="no"/>
            derly as they haue in the Masse book. Wee haue also formes of prayinge rather <lb/>
            lik playinge <del rend="strikethrough">then</del> prayinge from deliuerances from Tempestes thunders <lb/>
            and such lik when there is noe appearance of danger And there are also <lb/>
            answeres and sett repetitions, chapters and Creede: much Can<ex>n</ex>onicall <lb/>
            scripture to edification om<ex>m</ex>itted by readinge of mattens and Evensonges and <lb/>
            some Apocripha taken in./
         </p>
         <p>
            Nowe suppose there were noe faulte in matter or forme yet wee cannot re=<lb break="no"/>
            ceave the book. For admitte yt were framed all of scripture phrases and <lb/>
            sentences, yet yt bringethe a readinge minister and there w<ex>i</ex>th ignorance and <lb/>
            blyndenesse upon the people. For yf an ignorante Asse cann but reade this <lb/>
            book and gett orders, hee may solemnize marriage, minister the supper of <lb/>
            the Lorde and sufficiently discharge the function of ministration. On the other <lb/>
            side the ableste preacher may use noe other wordes in the tyme of com<ex>m</ex>on <lb/>
            prayer and ministration of the sacram<ex>en</ex>tes then are p<ex>re</ex>scribed in the book. Soe <lb/>
            wee shall make an Asse a minister, and the ableste minister an Asse. The <lb/>
            mattens shall haue place before preachinge and oftentymes shall stande <lb/>
            in steede of yt.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Englishe service booke was tempered in the begin<ex>n</ex>inge soe farre <hi rend="underline">to the</hi> <lb/>
            humor of the Papistes that <hi rend="underline">the Pope offred to ratifie yt upon a Condycon</hi>: <lb/>
            But it hath ever bynn the occasion of much greife and trouble amongst the <lb/>
            godly and never <hi rend="underline">had quiett possession amongst them synce the abolishinge <lb/>
               of popery</hi> but hath bynn generally detested of the people of better note, as <lb/>
            hath appeared in sondry p<ex>ar</ex>liam<ex>en</ex>tes whoe haue refused to ratifie yt. This book <lb/>
            is the same but more subtelly polished w<ex>i</ex>th some alterations &amp; additions./

         <p>

            overthrowe of religion. Remember what the Prophet Esay saide, The <lb/>
