            This is <ex>th</ex>e great Counsell (of <ex>th</ex>e Kingdo<ex>m</ex>, and here (if not here alone) his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie may see  <lb/>
            (as in <add place="above">true</add> a glasse) <ex>th</ex>e state of <ex>th</ex>e hole Kingdo<ex>m</ex>. Wee are cauled hether by his writts, to giue <lb/>
            him faithfull counselll such as may stand with his honor. but <ex>tha</ex>t wee must doe <lb/>

            and this wee must doe with out feare. Let vs not then doe like Cambises Iudge  <lb/>
            who being demanded of him tuching something which was vnlawfull, said <lb/>
            <ex>tha</ex>t if it weare not written, then <ex>th</ex>e Persian Kings might what they listed. This way <lb/>
            base flattery, fitter for reprofe then Imitation. And as flattery soe feare takes  <lb/>
            awaie <ex>th</ex>e iudgment. For my owne Part, I shall shew both these, and speake my con=<lb break="no"/>
            cienc, with as much duty to his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie (as any man) not negleckting <ex>th</ex>e Publiqe <lb/>
            But how can wee speake our affecktions while wee releiue our fears or spea<supplied reason="damage">k</supplied> <lb/>
            of giuing, till wee know wheather wee haue any thing to giue, or not for if his <lb/>
            Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie bee perswaded hee may take what hee will, what nede wee giue. That this hath <lb/>
            bine done it appears by billiting of Soldiers, a thing noe way aduantagious <lb/>
            but a burthen to <ex>th</ex>e Co<ex>m</ex>monwelth. The Imprisonment of gentlemen for <ex>th</ex>e lone, <lb/>
            who if they had done contrary for feare, there fault had bine as great as thers <lb/>
            <ex>tha</ex>t weare proiecktors in it to countenanc these procedings, hath it not bin prea=<lb break="no"/>
            ched (nay rather prated) All we haue is <ex>th</ex>e Kings. But these forsake there owne <lb/>
            cauling, and turne ignorant statesmen, Wee see how willing they would bee <lb/>
            to chang a good conscience for a Bisshopbrig. It is to apparent <ex>th</ex>e people <lb/>
            suffer more now then euer they did; will you know <ex>th</ex>e true reason wee shall <lb/>
            finde those Princes haue bine in greatest wants, and necessities, <ex>tha</ex>t haue <lb/>
            exackted most from there subieckts. The reason is plain. a Prince is <lb/>
            strongest by faithfull and wise counsell. I would I could truly say such <lb/>
            had bine imployed abroade, I speake <del rend="strikethrough">not</del> this to <ex>th</ex>e eand to shew <ex>th</ex>e defeckt <lb/>
            procedes not from his howse. I confesse hee is noe good subieckt <ex>tha</ex>t will <lb/>
            not willingly, and solely lay downe his life, when <ex>th</ex>e eand may bee <ex>th</ex>e  <lb/>
            seruice of his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie, and <ex>th</ex>e good of <ex>th</ex>e Commonwelth. But hee is noe good <lb/>
            subieckt, but a slaue, <ex>tha</ex>t will haue his goods taken away against his <lb/>
            will, and his liberty against <ex>th</ex>e laws of <ex>th</ex>e Kingdome. In doing this <lb/>
            wee shall but tred <ex>th</ex>e steps of our foreFathers, who still preferred <ex>th</ex>e  <lb/>
            publiqe intrest before there owne liues. if we are a wrong to vs, our <lb/>
            posterit, and to our consciences, for to forgoe this. Wee shall doe <lb/>
            well to present to his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie I offer this in generall thinking <lb/>
            <ex>th</ex>e particuler fitter for committes. and what I now say or shall <lb/>
            then say I submit to better iudgments
