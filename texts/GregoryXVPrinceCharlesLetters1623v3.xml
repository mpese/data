            I haue receiued your holinesse Letter with such thankfulnesse <lb/>
            and respecte as is due to the loue and pietie with which <lb/>
            your holinesse writt it And especiallie it gaue me much <lb/>

            from the Christian Com<ex>m</ex>on wealth maye bee reduced to a <lb/>

            of discord hath laboured in sowinge hatred and discention <lb/>
            amongst Christian Princes, Soe that I deeme it a <lb/>

            Neither doe I esteeme a greater honour to discend from such <lb/>
