            of such as shall continue in their disobedient courses, it is not <lb/>
            occasioned by us, but by their owne procurements: This was <lb/>
            the kings aunsweare to their humble propositions, which were <lb/>
            to haue bine agreed vppon Mondaye the last weeke, but there <lb/>
            was much adoe, whether there should bee B<ex>isho</ex>pps yea, or noe, <lb/>
            The Kinge prest to haue Bi<ex>sho</ex>pps, and the scotch Commissioners, <lb/>
            (Mr. Hinderson the moderator, being nowe admitted for one) <lb/>
            most humblie presented it to his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie, that the order of B<ex>isho</ex>pps <lb/>
            was against the lawe of the land, which his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie had promisd <lb/>

            next Assembly to bee held the 6th of August at Edenburge, <lb/>
            and the Parliament the 20th followeing. Then, the word <lb/>
            pretended generall Assembly at Glasco, had almost broake off <lb/>
            the treaty, The Kinge would haue that a pretended generall

               but such as are warranted by acts of Parliaments: Tuesdaie last weeke all things were agreed vppon according to the foresaid <lb/>

               to give order to the Fleete in the in the Freith to retire: the same daye, the kinge sent severall persons to take possession of all <lb/>

            here, to sett all scotch men, nowe in prison, at liberty, and to <lb/>
            free all their shipps and goods arrested: This agreement was <lb/>
            proclaymed in both armyes, The scotch army gave <unclear/> <lb/>
            a greate shoute, crying God save the kinge, and the Devill take <lb/>
            all their B<ex>isho</ex>pps: It was desired, that the kinge would haue pleasd <lb/>
            to come into the scotch armye, that all the collours might bee layd <lb/>
            downe at his feete, but some reasons were alleadged, that hee <lb/>
            went not; lord Rothus, and Mr Hinderson, as it is commonly <lb/>
            reported, haue gaind a greate reputation by their most humble <lb/>
            mannageing of this treaty, for although they p<ex>er</ex>formd every <lb/>
            poynt of their Commission to their best advantage, yet they <lb/>
            did it with that humillity, and temper, as his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie was well <lb/>
            pleasd with the manner of it: In the mannageing of this treaty <lb/>
            it come to bee a question made by his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie whether an <lb/>
            Assembly might bee kept without him, which lord Rothus, and Mr <lb/>
            Hinderson cleard both of them concludeing that by their lawes,  <lb/>
            It might bee kept without his Ma<ex>jes</ex>t<ex>ies</ex> presence, but yet much <lb/>
            better with it: Alsoe, the kinge demaunded, or rather said, <lb/>

            communicate your Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie because you are soe iust soe pious, <lb/>

            on alsoe; Mr Hinderson had some <del rend="strikethrough">oppertunty</del> oppertunity to <lb/>
            touch uppon the kings declaration, the printed booke, that relates <lb/>
            all passages of scotch disorders published by his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie and by <lb/>
            the waye, hee insinuates yt to his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie: That if soe bee hee <lb/>
