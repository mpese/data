            Ytt may please yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps I shall humblie crave att yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps handes <lb/>

            this tyme trouble yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps a verie strange entrance. For in the <lb/>
            middest of a state of as greate affliction, as I thinke a mortall <lb/>
            man can endure, (honour beinge aboue life) I shall begynn w<ex>i</ex>th <lb/>
            the profession of gladnes in some thinges. The first is, that <lb/>
            hereafter the greatnes of a Iudge or magistrate shalbee noe <lb/>
            sanctuarye or protecc<ex>i</ex>on of guiltynes, w<ex>hi</ex>ch in fewe words is the <lb/>

            likenes of corrupc<ex>i</ex>on (though itt weare att a greate distance) as <lb/>
            from a Serpent, w<ex>hi</ex>ch tendeth to the purginge of the Courtes of <lb/>
            Iustice, and the reduceinge them to their dewe honour and <lb/>
            splendor: And in theise twoe poynts (God is my witness) that <lb/>
            though itt bee my fortune, to bee the Anvill <add place="above">on</add> w<ex>hi</ex>ch theise good effects <lb/>
            are beaten and wrought, I take noe small comforte: Butt to pass <lb/>
            from the motions of my hart whereof God is onlie Iudge, to the <lb/>
            merittes of my Cause, whereof yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps are Iudges vnder God, and <lb/>
            his Leiften<ex>a</ex>nt. I doe vnderstand that there hath been heretofore <lb/>
            expected from mee some Iustificac<ex>i</ex>on: And therefore I haue chosen <lb/>
            onlie <add place="above">one</add> Iustificac<ex>i</ex>on in stead of all other, out of the Iustificac<ex>i</ex>ons <lb/>
            of Iob: For after the cleare submission and confession w<ex>hi</ex>ch I shall <lb/>

            where they come not home or the scruple touchinge the creditt <lb/>
            of the wittnesses; neyther will I represent vnto yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps ho<unclear>we</unclear> <lb/>
            farr a defence in divers thinges extenuate the offence in respect <lb/>

            that I have spoken to yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps as Iudges, I shall say a fewe <lb/>

            Cause to yo<ex>u</ex>r noble mindes and magnanimous affecc<ex>i</ex>ons. Yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps <lb/>
            are not simplie Iudges but Parliamentarie Iudges, you have a <lb/>
            further extent of arbitrarye power, then other Courts, and if yo<ex>u</ex>r <lb/>
            Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps bee not tyed by the ordynarie Course of Courts or presidents, <lb/>
            in poynts of strictnes and severitye, much more of mercye and <lb/>

            to give mee leave to tell you a storie. Titus Manlius tooke his <lb/>
            sonnes life for givinge battaile against the prohibic<ex>i</ex>on of his gen<ex>er</ex>all, <lb/>
            not manie yeares after the like severitie was pursued by <lb/>
            Papi<del rend="strikethrough">rius</del>
                <add place="above">rius</add> Cursor the dictator against Quintus Maximus, <lb/>
            who beinge upon the poynt to bee sentensed by the intercession of <lb/>
            some princypall p<ex>er</ex>sons of the Senate, was spared: Wherevpon <lb/>
            Livye maketh this grave and gratious observasion. Neque minus <lb/>
            firmata est disciplina militaris periculo Quinti Maximi <lb/>
            qu<ex>am</ex> miserabili <del rend="strikethrough">q</del> suplici<unclear>

                </unclear>: The discipline of <lb/>
            Warr was noe less established by the questionninge of Quintus <lb/>
            Maximus, then by the punishm<ex>en</ex>t of this Manlius: And the same <lb/>
            reason is of the reformac<ex>i</ex>on of Iustice, for the questionninge of <lb/>
            men of <del rend="strikethrough">e</del> eminent places hath the same terror, though not the <lb/>
            same rigour w<ex>i</ex>th the punishm<ex>en</ex>t; But my case stayeth not there. <lb/>
            For my humble desier is, that his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie would take the Seale into his <lb/>
            hands w<ex>hi</ex>ch is a greate downefall and may serve, I hope in itt selfe <lb/>

            Sou<ex>er</ex>aigne, a Kinge of incomparable Clemencie, and whose hart <lb/>
            is inscrutable for wisedome and goodnes; Yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps will remember <lb/>
            that there satt not three hundred yeeres before a Prince in yo<ex>u</ex>r <lb/>
            howse, and never such a Prince whose presence deserveth to bee <lb/>
            made memorable by Records and Acts mixt w<ex>i</ex>th mercye and <lb/>
            iustice. Yo<ex>u</ex>r selves are eyther Nobles (and Compassion ever beateth <lb/>
            in the Vaynes of Noble bloud) or Reverend Prelates whoe are the <lb/>
            servants of him that would not berate the bruised Reede nor <lb/>
            quench the smoakinge flax: You all sitt vpon an highe staye <lb/>
            and therefore cannot but bee more sensible of the Changes of the <lb/>
            world and of the fall of anie in high place: Neyther will yo<ex>u</ex>r <lb/>
            Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps forget, that there are vitia temporis as well as vitia <lb/>
            hominis and that the beginninge of reformac<ex>i</ex>ons hath the <lb/>
            Contrarye power to the poole. Bethesba for that had strength <lb/>
            to cure onlie him, that was first cast in, and this hathe <lb/>
            com<ex>m</ex>onlye strength to hurt him onlie that is first cast in. And <lb/>
            for my part I wishe itt might staie there and goe noe further. <lb/>
            Lastlie I assure my selfe yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps haue a noble feelinge of mee <lb/>
            as a member of yo<ex>u</ex>r owne bodye, and one that in this verye <lb/>
            Session had some taste of yo<ex>u</ex>r lovinge affecc<ex>i</ex>ons w<ex>hi</ex>ch I hope <lb/>
            was not a lighteninge before the death of them, but rather <lb/>
            a sparke of that grace w<ex>hi</ex>ch nowe in the Conclusion will more <lb/>
            appeare: And therefore my humble suite to yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps is, that my <lb/>
            penetent submission may bee my sentence, and the loss of the <lb/>
            Seale my punishm<ex>en</ex>t and that yo<ex>u</ex>r Lo<ex>rdshi</ex>ps will spare my further <lb/>
            sentence, but recommend mee to his Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties Grace and pardon for <lb/>
