            The infinte obligation which I owe to the <lb/>
            Vniversity of Cambridge for the late most ample testimony <lb/>
            of their great love &amp; affection towards me, emboldens me <lb/>
            to borrow your help, to make known vnto them my vnfained <lb/>
            thankfullnes; wherein I confesse, that the love and favour <lb/>
            which they have expressed vnto me, joined with the fashion <lb/>
            of it, doth farre exceed the weak expressions of so feeble <lb/>
            a style as mine is: For they have bin pleased out of their <lb/>
            aboundant affection, to name me to one of the greatest Ho=<lb break="no"/>
            nours of this Kingdome, without any suit or meanes of mine, <lb/>
            which was the Chancellourship of the Vniversity; the voting <lb/>
            whereof in this noble fashion I account as much, as could befall <lb/>
            me, &amp; receiue it with as much thankfullnes, as if I were <lb/>
            in full possession of the place. I must therefore intreat <lb/>
            you to disperse this my thankfull acknowledgment to all <lb/>
            my worthie freinds there, who have so freely bestowed their <lb/>
            voices &amp; unsought for favours upon me: and this labour <lb/>
            I do the rather lay vpon you, because you know I put you <lb/>
            to none in making meanes for me; which I should vndoubtedly <lb/>
            have done, if I had preconceived any intention of standing <lb/>
            for this Dignitie so often wedded by men of high places <lb/>
            &amp; noble families of this Realme, whereof my honoured Father <lb/>
            deceased enjoyed the late testimonie, &amp; my unkle before him, <lb/>
            &amp; not ceasing there, but expressed vnto me now by an hae=<lb break="no"/>
            reditary affection. Thus much I pray you, to make knowne <lb/>
            for me, with this farther assurance, that as I had my first <lb/>
            breeding to my great honour in Cambridge, so I will live <lb/>

            Chancellorship vpon me, I must confesse, you have satisfyed <lb/>
            an ambition of mine owne (which I hope will never forsake <lb/>
            me) and that is, to be well thought of by men that deserve <lb/>
            well, &amp; men of your profession: yet I cannot attribute this honour <lb/>
            to any desert in me, but to a respect you beare the sacred <lb/>
            memorie of my dead Master the King of Schollers, who loved <lb/>
            you, &amp; honoured you often with his presence; &amp; to my Gracious <lb/>
            Master now living, who inherits with his blessed Fathers <lb/>
            vertues, the affetions he beare your Vniverstitie. I beseech <lb/>
            you, as you have now made your choise with so many kind <lb/>
            &amp; noble circumstances, as the manner is to me as much as the <lb/>
            matter: so to assure your selves, that you have cast your votes <lb/>
            vpon your Servant, who is as apprehensive of the time you <lb/>
            have shewed your affections in, as of the honour you have given <lb/>
            him. And I earnestly request you all, that you would be <lb/>
            pleased not to judge me comparatively, by the successe and <lb/>
            happines you have had in your former choise of Chancellors, <lb/>
            who as they knew better (perhaps by an advantage of education <lb/>
            in your Vniversity) how to value the desert of men of your <lb/>
            qualities &amp; degrees: so could they not be more willing to cherish <lb/>
            them then my selfe, who will make amends for my want of <lb/>
            Schollership, in my love vnto the Professors of it, &amp; to the <lb/>
