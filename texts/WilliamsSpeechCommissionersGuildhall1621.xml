            My Lordes and Gentlemen.

         <p>
            I shall not neede to speake many wordes, vpon <lb/>
            the occasion of this o<ex>u</ex>r meeting, You haue heard <lb/>
            by the reading of the Comission, that it is a <lb/>
            gathering of a part of that Subsidie, w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>
            was graunted by the parliament, as yet <lb/>
            assembled, as a supplie and a support to the <lb/>
            manifold occasions of the kinges expences. /
         </p>
         <p>
            Payment of Subsedies is no newe thing, <lb/>
            but hath his begynnyng from the lawe of God, <lb/>
            the Lawe of reason, and the contynuall practise <lb/>
            of this Kingdome. Now for Godes Lawe it <lb/>
            is apparant by the demonstrations of St Paule <lb/>
            in the 13. to the <hi rend="italic">Romans the .6. &amp; .7. verses:</hi> <lb/>
            Princes are Godes servantes, attending con=<lb break="no"/>

            First Princes they are servantes, and to <lb/>
            deny that w<ex>hi</ex>ch is due vnto s<ex>er</ex>vantes is scarce <lb/>
            honestie; Secondly they are Godes  <lb/>

            Godes servantes is impietie; Thirdly they <lb/>
            are contynually attending (that is) diligent <lb/>
            servantes, and to deny that w<ex>hi</ex>ch is due vnto <lb/>
            diligent servantes, is a strange kind of obstinacy. <lb/>
            Fourthly they are servantes attending vpon <lb/>
            the Church, and comon wealth, and to denye <lb/>
            that w<ex>hi</ex>ch is due to such servantes of the <lb/>

         <p>
            And for the Lawe of reason, compared to the <lb/>
