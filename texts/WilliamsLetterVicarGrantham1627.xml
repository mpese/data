            S<ex>i</ex>r w<ex>i</ex>th my hearty com<ex>m</ex>endac<ex>i</ex>ons when I spake w<ex>i</ex>th you laste I tolde you that the standinge <lb/>
            of the com<ex>m</ex>union table was to me a thinge soe indifferente that vnlesse offence <lb/>
            were taken by the Towne against yt I shoulde never remove yt. That w<ex>hi</ex>ch I <lb/>
            did not then suspecte is come to passe <gap unit="chars" extent="3"/> Your Alderman whome I haue <lb/>
            knowne theise 17: or 18. yeres to bee a discreete and modeste man farr from <lb/>
            the humor of innovation togeather w<ex>i</ex>th the better sorte of the towne have <lb/>
            complayned against yt, and I haue w<ex>i</ex>thout takinge notice of you or any touche <lb/>
            in one sillable upon yo<ex>u</ex>r reputac<ex>i</ex>on appointed the Churchwardens whome <lb/>
            yt doth necessarily concerne vnder the diocesan to alter yt for the tyme <lb/>
            as you may see by the copie inclosed./ Nowe for yo<ex>u</ex>r owne satisfaction and <lb/>
            my poore advise for the future, I haue written unto you somewhat more att <lb/>
            large then I use to expresse my selfe in this kynde. I doe therfore (to deale <lb/>

            in the officiatinge of divine service: that you presidente yo<ex>u</ex>r selfe w<ex>i</ex>th the formes <lb/>
            in his ma<ex>jes</ex>ties chapple, and in the Quyres in the Cathedrall Churche: yf yo<ex>u</ex>r <lb/>
            Quier (as those other) coulde contayne yo<ex>u</ex>r whole congregation, and that you doe <lb/>
            the <hi rend="underline">reverence appointed by the Cannons to the blessed name of Iesus</hi>, soe it bee <lb/>
            done humbly not affectedly to p<ex>ro</ex>cure the devotion, not the derision of the <lb/>
            p<ex>ar</ex>ishioners, and that you doe not mayntayne yt <foreign xml:lang="la">rationibus non cogentibus</foreign> <lb/>
            and soe spoyle a good cause by a badd argum<ex>en</ex>t: Those thinges I allowe and <lb/>
            practise: but that you shoulde bee soe violente for an aulter att the upper <lb/>
            ende of the Quier, that yo<ex>u</ex>r table oughte to stande aulterwise, that the fixinge <lb/>
            therof in the Quier is canonicall, and that it oughte not to bee removed in <lb/>
            the body of the churche I conceive to bee in you soe many mistakinges: for that <lb/>
