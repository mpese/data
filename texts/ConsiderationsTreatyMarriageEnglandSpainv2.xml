            1 The meanest of the houshold of faith are much greater then the greatest of those that are w<ex>i</ex>thout <lb/>
            for they are borne to a greate inheritaunce, These are the promises, God is their god, and w<ex>i</ex>th <lb/>

            3 Is not England stronger at this pr<ex>e</ex>sent and Spaine weaker then heretofore; whence then <lb/>
            any Cause of feare, but alow that the state of England, stood in feare of any daunger <lb/>
            from Spaine, will this alliance secure them; the feare is Idle, and the remedie Idler <lb/>

           	follow his intended Course when the season is fitt for it; England doth hinder his designes <lb/>
           	therefore he would match w<ex>i</ex>th England, to haue the free passage for them, and if he were in <lb/>
           quiet <add place="above">possession</add> of all the 17 prouinces then would they be made a staple and storehouse for all things <lb/>

            The States may in time grow greate, and their greatnesse dangerous, but Spaine <lb/>
            is both the one and the other allreadie and this alliance will add much vnto him, <lb/>
            there may also grow iealousie and vnkindnesse and thence open enmitie betweene <lb/>
            England and them, And so on the otherside things may be so discreetlie carried, as <lb/>
            they two may entertaine good amitie and correspondencye one w<ex>i</ex>th another for common defence <lb/>
            for they both professe the same religion and their estate and Condition, seeme to vnite them <lb/>

            doe they carrye themselves now vnkindlie or somewhat vnrespectfullie that doth not soe <lb/>
            vrgentlie prooue, that they may become enemies hereafter, as therevpon to ground a <lb/>

            yet it is the scope that Spaine aimeth att, and that p<ex>er</ex>happs may make them somewhat <lb/>
            to neglect England, but remove the Cause and the effect will cease, let them be <lb/>
            assured of their freindshipp, and they will be found true and respectfull freinds, if <lb/>
            they prosper and grow great, who knoweth whether it be not of god by such weake <lb/>
            meanes to pull downe the loftinesse of Spaine, and then to w<ex>i</ex>thstand them, were <lb/>
            to runne against a Rock. the very first occac<ex>i</ex>on of their libertie was the deriving of <lb/>
            them to despaire, which made them to take hart and resoluc<ex>i</ex>on to resist, the violence <lb/>
            that was offered wherein being encouraged with good successe, and feeling their owne <lb/>
            <sic>strenght</sic> they haue in time made such further progresse, as is this day to be seene, <lb/>
            Better then for England to make <add place="above">vse of</add> a necessarie euill, and runn a Course with them <lb/>
            whereby they may haue a part in their well speeding, then to ioyne with Spaine <lb/>

            ends, and must needs draw after them the ouerthrow of the Cause of religion <lb/>
            and ruinne of the state, and will neuer prooue but a secret enemie and doubtfull <lb/>
            freind, and it must not in this place be forgotton, that if true professors, be iustly <lb/>
            reproued for going to law before heathen Iudges, much lesse may they side themselues <lb/>

           	be given then in England. The English seeke not to make any fortunes in Scotland, but <lb/>
           	if the French should be importunate, they are alsoe impatient, let them finde Visage de Boy, <lb/>
           	and yo<ex>u</ex>r Coldenesse shall were out their earnestnesse!/
        </p>
        <p>
            7 The strength w<ex>hi</ex>ch the Scottish faction may gather by the alliance, of france, is but a p<ex>ar</ex>ticuler <lb/>
           	considerac<ex>i</ex>on against w<ex>hi</ex>ch may be opposed the greatnesse that the Spanish faction will <lb/>
           	grow vnto by a match with Spaine to the daunger of the state./
        </p>
        <p>
           	This answere doth greatlie lay open the value of such aduantages, as England doth <lb/>
           	promise him selfe by matching w<ex>i</ex>th Spaine, w<ex>hi</ex>ch how deerely they would notw<ex>i</ex>thstanding <lb/>
           	be bought, will more p<ex>ar</ex>ticularlye appeare, if knowledge be also taken for the inconveniences <lb/>
           	and mischeefs, would follow, for the better conceauing whereof his ends are seriouslie <lb/>
           	to be examined, for it is not likelye that Spaine <sic>ariged</sic> and State Catholique, who <lb/>
           	hath both religion and state quarrels against England, will yeild to giue his daughter in <lb/>
           	marriage to England, Nay rather doth offer great sommes for the Compassing thereof <lb/>
           	but that he looketh for a great returne, <hi rend="italic">

        </p>
        <p>
           	The price of this alliance therefore willbe the breaking of the match w<ex>i</ex>th france, to the <lb/>
           	weakning both of England and france wherby he may haue the greater footing, in <lb/>
           	either deuiding England from his Allies especially from the states of the vinited <hi rend="italic">Prouinces</hi> <lb/>
           	the making way for another match, betweene his second sonne (whom he hath  plott to set <lb/>
           	in the low Countries, and from thence to promote him if he cann to the Crowne Imperiall <lb/>
           	and another daughter of France, w<ex>hi</ex>ch would giue so greate an alarme to the whole side <lb/>
           	of those of the religion if the pr<ex>e</ex>tended match w<ex>i</ex>th England come not betweene, And <lb/>
           	altering in time the state of religion in England, whereof if hee had noe hope, neither <lb/>
           	would he euer harken to the match, for none must thinke that he will treate such an alliance <lb/>
           	without the priuitie and Aduises of his deuines, or that they will not give their consent <lb/>
           	to it, but vpon greate probabitie, that it shall tend to the furtherance of their Catholique faith <lb/>
           	The supposed Catholique religion is knowne to be in Spaine one of the fundamentall <lb/>
           	lawes of their estate, and not doubte but Spaine is himselfe a very regid Romish <lb/>
           	Catholique, the further therefore he speedeth his religion the more satisfaction it is vnto <lb/>
           	his conscience, and the more doth he propp and increase his greatnesse, namely <lb/>
           	because those of that religion that are most deuout but especiallie the greater part of the <lb/>
           	Clergie throughout Christendome, haue their eyes fixed vppon him, as vppon the greatest stay and <lb/>
            piller of their Catholique faith, who therefore he should match w<ex>i</ex>th an heretique (so they terme in England) <lb/>
            but w<ex>i</ex>th a setled purpose by such meanes to roote out heresie, would both wrong his one Conscience <lb/>
            and loose his reputac<ex>i</ex>on, amongst all these of his beleefe to the ouer greate weakening of <lb/>
            his estate, w<ex>hi</ex>ch errour none of sound iudgment, that knoweth Spaine well, cann easily <lb/>
            beleeue that he will euer Committ. /

        <p>
           That a Change or tollerac<ex>i</ex>on of religion should happen in England by meanes of the intended <lb/>
           match is more to be feared then any cann warrant to be impossible, wherein that were well <lb/>
           worth the labour to find out what hopes Spaine doth ground vppon, and what possibilitie <lb/>
           there is, that the same may be disappointed, in the meane time very likelie that it is in generall <lb/>

           and greater incouragement no small number of Subiects want teaching, and so <lb/>
           the easier shaken, many waver, and many are new fangled, the more prepared for a <lb/>

           all the bodye, and true religion is vnsatiable sorte it w<ex>i</ex>th selfe worshipp, and it will <lb/>
           soone forsake his dwelling place./
        </p>
        <p>
           If Spaine can proue a tollerac<ex>i</ex>on of religion (w<ex>hi</ex>ch must needs be followed w<ex>i</ex>th the <lb/>
           ruine of the state) he may then assure himselfe of a side w<ex>hi</ex>ch will allwaies be able either <lb/>
           directlie or indirectlie to divert the state from hinderinge his designes aswell in the low <lb/>
           Countries as wheresoeuer else.
        </p>
        <p>
           	And though he should not pr<ex>e</ex>vaile at the first by practise to p<ex>ro</ex>cure a tolleration of Religion (w<ex>hi</ex>ch <lb/>
           	neuerthelesse the very increasing of the number of papists will of it selfe effect in <lb/>

           	p<ex>er</ex>verted in religion he will notwithstanding be in good hope, that the state may be stayed and <lb/>
           	hindered from opposing it selfe against his designes, by the working of his faction, and the <lb/>
           	iealousie, that wilbe conceaved of the papists within the realme./
        </p>
         <p>
            And whether his hopes may faile him or noe yet if he should vppon such ground make any <lb/>
           attempt, against those of the vnited prouinces, it would not but fall out, to the greate trouble <lb/>
           annoyance, and daunger of the state, especiall if he send his forces by Sea, for then must <lb/>
           England vppon such occac<ex>i</ex>on either rigg out their nauie to see that he keepe his Course <lb/>
           which will alwaies be a matter of greate burthen &amp; Charge or otherwise abide the hazard <del rend="strikethrough">of</del> <lb/>

        </p>
        <p>
           Now the alliance w<ex>i</ex>th Spaine will not onelie scare and discourage in generall the <lb/>

           But also breed a p<ex>ar</ex>ticuler iealousie in those of the vnited Prouinces when they shall see both <lb/>
           that poperie increaseth, or that Spaine hath a part or faction within the realme, whereof one <lb/>
           of these two Mischeefs must consequentlie follow, either that they will make their peace w<ex>i</ex>th <lb/>

           things cannot long stand without breaking forth into termes of open hostilitie./
        </p>
        <p>
           And for the state of those prouinces though strong by Sea, alliance and scituac<ex>i</ex>on, yet are not <lb/>
           the foundations thereof so sure that England may w<ex>i</ex>th safetie leave them to themselves for the <lb/>
           later sects and questions about matters of religion threatens their disvnion, and Spaine <lb/>
           that lieth Continuallie in waite for their libertie hath his penc<ex>i</ex>oners, and dailie practises <lb/>

           had then plotts against France, which now it hath not, the greatest vse of leagues and <lb/>
