            In my last letter I menti-<lb break="no"/>
            ond, howe they had made an explanation of those Articles of <lb/>
            agreement, upon which both armyes were disbanded, I sett <lb/>
            downe noe perticulers in my letter, but I will onely mention one <lb/>
            or twoe at this tyme, first they alleadge, That his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie should <lb/>

               declare hee had noe ill opinion of his subiects of Scotland, notwithstanding hee had declard the contrarye in severall former pro=<lb break="no"/>
               clamations, but required those papers should stand for his creditt, and for the poynt of honour with forraine nations, <lb/>
               and required, they should not stand with him for words, and expressions soe longe as they obteyned the matter: 2.ly they doe <lb/>
               explane that his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie should approve of the late Assembly of Glasco, though it bee sett downe a pretended Assembly in <lb/>
               the late Articles, Then that hee should acknowledge the lawfullnesse of their ruleing Elders: alsoe, that his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie should <lb/>
               absolutely quite Episcopaci: I am assured by verie <del rend="strikethrough">ill</del> well affected men, There is nothing of all this true: It is true,

            they stood upon the word pretended Assembly, as I wrote of at the <lb/>
            tyme, when the Articles were in proposition, And that, they prest <lb/>
            that the kinge would absolutely quite Episcopacie, to the first, <lb/>
            the kinge would never coment, and therefore the scotch <lb/>
            Commissioners did wave it: and for quiteing Episcopacie, <lb/>
            his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie promisd, if soe bee they could make it appeare in their <lb/>
            next Assembly, Episcopacie was against the lawes, and <lb/>
            constitutions of their Church, then hee would quite Episcop=<lb break="no"/>
            cie, but not till then, that they made it soe to appeare: <lb/>
            Concerninge their owne Commissioners, They are iealous of <lb/>
            them, onely because they doe not approve of their explanations <lb/>
            and therefore they would not permitt them to repaire to <lb/>
            his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie to Barwicke before his comeing thence, as alsoe, <lb/>
            because their Commissioners doe dislike their many insole=<lb break="no"/>
            ncies lately committed by them, upon the kings party in <lb/>
            Scotland, for doeing severall outrages upon them, and calling <lb/>
            them Traytors, because they adhere to his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie according to the <lb/>
            agreement, his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie desired of the Presbiteries, according to <lb/>
            the Articles of agreement, that some <del rend="strikethrough">Presbiteries</del>
                <add place="above">ministers</add>, thrust out <lb/>
            by Glasco Assembly might bee restord by the Presbiteries, but <lb/>
            this they would not graunt him, and therefore since his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie <lb/>
            could soe little prevaile in that where in hee ought to haue bine <lb/>
            obayed, according to the Articles of agreement: hee hath left <lb/>

            which shall bee signified to them before their meeteing of <lb/>
            the 12.th of August: Concerning their explanation, whome <lb/>
            some of the english nobillity are chargd to haue reade, and <lb/>
            approvd of: some of those lords never sawe them till his Ma<ex>jes</ex>tie <lb/>
