            Church, and that not out of zeale and charity, but as plainely appeareth <lb/>
            by many of their acc<ex>i</ex>ons, out of mallice &amp; envye by the Comission<ex>e</ex>rs  <lb/>
            authorized by both yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties for the agreeing of the peace it was <lb/>

            Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties vassalls heere should be questioned w<ex>i</ex>th for matter of Religion, it <lb/>
            was not possible that could exercise any commerce in those kingdomes <lb/>
            where they should be no one moment assured either of their good<ex>es</ex> or <lb/>
            libertyes, It was therefore p<ex>ro</ex>vided that they should in noe Wise bee <lb/>
            impeached, but in case of scandall, And that scandall (w<ex>i</ex>th yo<ex>u</ex>r Ma<ex>jes</ex>ties <lb/>

            teacheing of the gospell &amp; the abolition of the Law cermoniall was <lb/>
            said to be to both howses of Israell a stone of scandall, The synn <lb/>
            of Dauid, if it had onlye laid covered in his owne hearte, or ben <lb/>
            committed in private, should not haue ben eithe published or punished <lb/>
